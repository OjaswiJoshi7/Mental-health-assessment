So much happened within 24 hours that is severely affecting my mental health,i don t know have anyone to talk to i mean i do have a support system but i just don t want to on monday i was 6 weeks pregnant and i started spotting so i m still in the middle of a miscarriage a few hours after the spotting i found out that a very close family member passed away unexpectedly an hour after that i received a phone call from the number i didn t recognize and when i answered it it was a police officer at first i thought it was a scam when he asked for the name and i said there s no one here with that name he then said that he thought my 16 year old son is dating her then it clicked and i said oh yes my 16 year old son and her started dating a week ago but we haven t met her it turns out that she was a runaway and the mother thought she might be at my house i told him no my children were at their dad s house and he asked if it was possible that she was there i said i didn t think so but i would call him and find out i couldn t get a hold of him and when i finally got a hold of my son he told me that yes this 15 year old girl was over at their dad s house i was livid apparently my son didn t know she was a runaway but regardless i would never allow a girl to spend the night he claims that he wanted her to leave but she just refused which i m not buying the crazy part is the dad allowing her to stay well because of that the cop said he had to childline and cyf would have to get involved i said even if i don t allow them to come over here because there s no custody agreement or anything and i m not allowing them over here after this incident he said he still had to they have yet to come i m not really worried about that but i just don t want them in my life because i was in group homes in foster homes and i ve done my best so my kids would never have to experience dealing with cyf on top of all of that i received my food stamps yesterday and they were stolen off my card i get 800 and something a month and we don t use it all so i had extra so i had a total of 1 300 00 they took it all and left it down to 1 28 the state that i live in stopped reimbursing stolen ebt benefits in december i don t know what else can go wrong i m trying really hard to be strong i have a really really loving fiance but he doesn t fully get it because we come from two different backgrounds he says we will get through this and can maintain such a positive attitude he doesn t understand that my entire life has been an uphill battle and i feel like i ve been at war my whole life nothing is ever easy just a week ago i got a new car and i was in such great spirits and then it just took 24 hours of one bad thing after another to totally destroy me again i don t know what i m trying to achieve here but thank you to anyone who read this far,7
My Cousin Went Crazy Today—Is This the End for Him?,i m reaching out to this community because i m really worried about my cousin who has been battling alcoholism for the past six years he s never liked drinking but after so much time he feels completely trapped in a cycle of addiction on top of that he has significant mental health issues and he lost his mother a while ago his family broke down which has only deepened his struggles today his behavior was really concerning he was talking constantly repeating words over and over and even making a song out of them he was jumping around in the bathroom laughing uncontrollably though it was forced almost like a nervous laughter he was narrating random nonsensical stories smiling in a way that didn t feel normal this isn t the way he usually behaves he s normally calm and thoughtful but today he was completely out of character he s been becoming more antisocial lately and despite me being the only one visiting him he still feels incredibly lonely he s tried therapy but it hasn t helped much and he often feels like he s beyond saving he has also mentioned feeling like he might end it all though not directly i m really scared for him but i don t know what to do anymore i love him deeply and i m doing everything i can to support him but i can t fix this alone i m looking for any advice support or resources whether it s therapy recommendations strategies to help him when he spirals or even just emotional support from people who understand what this is like i m open to any suggestions even if they re hard to hear please if anyone has experience with something similar or knows of any supportive communities i d really appreciate your input,5

I hate myself,im a 19yo male and a introvert with no one to talk to and i thought this would be a good idea to see if someone is able to help me in some way this is everything i thought whilst typing this post sorry if my english is bad as its not my first language i dont like anything about myself the way i look the way i sound the way i think everything about myself i hate i don t know what s wrong with me i get urges of anger but i am able to resist acting on it i have thoughts of ending my life i try to ignore them but they keep coming back and i am starting to think it ll be better to commit and spare everyone else the trouble of having me in their lives i feel like im just a useless human being taking up oxygen from everyone else maybe all i want is to be loved but i feel unworthy of it is it normal for a 19 year old to feel and think this way,3
How do you get past childhood abuse when you live with the abusers?,as i grew up my parents forced me to listen to them have sex and would mentally and verbally berate and destroy me if i ever spoke up in any way there s a memory crystal clear where my father bent down to look at me and said if you see the van rocking don t come knocking with a threatening tone i m pretty sure this all also plays a part in addictions and hypersexuality i deal with even when i m around friends who i know love me i can t shake the feeling of being an absolute creep or not normal at all i m still dependent on my parents can t move out anytime soon,8

Have I really been misdiagnosed?,i had my first psychotic episode in 2010 but i wasn t hospitalised and was treated in the community i was immediately diagnosed with undifferentiated schizophrenia over the years i saw various psychiatrists as many of them left the nhs and they gave me different diagnoses including bipolar disorder and one who said i had schizoaffective disorder bipolar type the issue is i was not hospitalised and the psychiatrists mostly seemed to focus on my mood issues which is why i think they leaned towards bipolar also being an issue along with schizophrenia a decade went by and then a new psychiatrist said that one psychotic episode wasn t enough to diagnose me with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder he helped me come off the antipsychotic i was taking but within weeks he left the clinic and the next psychiatrist put me on an antidepressant a few weeks later i had another psychotic episode which led to hospitalisation and i was put back on the antipsychotic a few more years passed the psychiatrist who initially took me off the antipsychotic came back and still doesn t believe i have schizoaffective or schizophrenia even after a second episode he suggested i get assessed for autism so i did and he was right i also have adhd my mood dysregulation symptoms are likely due to having autism i m also seeing a therapist who doesn t think i have schizophrenia or schizoaffective either i m feeling confused and unsure about my diagnosis i spent 15 years thinking i had a form of schizophrenia but if i don t have that then what is the explanation for my two psychotic episodes can the psychiatrist hide the fact that i do have schizophrenia from me,8

I think I don't deserve my wife,i m so depressed i feel like a fraud my wife is still beautiful way out of my league and she deserves someone better a guy without all this emotional baggage someone who actually enjoys life like she does he d take her on trips make her laugh and make her feel safe we have two kids but that wouldn t be an issue they d live with me every other week and life would go on if i m thinking this way it s because i love her we ve spent 20 years together but the truth is the more time goes by the deeper i sink into this black hole life isn t just meaningless it s pain second after second i ve tried therapy meds nothing changes i m a depressed guy and i always will be there s no cure for whatever s broken inside me what i deserve is to be left alone with a bottle of whiskey and my guitar until the end keeping her tied to this misery wouldn t be fair she deserves to live for me death feels like the only relief the light at the end of the tunnel,13
"Anyone wear ""fake happy Masks"" to fit into society?",i battle severe depression since 2024 due to my pet s death that traumatized me severely but i have to keep functioning in society because i still have 1 more little furbaby to look after and thus must work and school to survive and give her a good life the sad thing is i learned that if i express my true self as in letting my grief depression sadness show ie letting my tears escape not wanting to engage in chatter nor wanting to smile people aka family work colleagues classmates random people will treat me poorly chastise or scold me feel uncomfortable around me avoid ghost me it s ironic that people treat me poorly when i need support the most during my vulnerable time i turned this all around by putting on a stage personality as a social experiment and it worked not because i want to but because i need to survive by surviving i mean i need to get good grades sustain a good job to make income get people to feel comfortable around me so it keeps life peaceful and drama free i put on this perfectly fake happy girl act each day in and day out as if i m performing on a stage the moment i get out of bed hair do done make up on fake smile up and out to the world i go it gets exhausting i purposely write funny posts inject humor into the way i talk say jokes to get people laughing around me smile and laugh a lot i can pull it off so naturally i used to be really good in drama club in highschool theater people at my university and work think i m this giant cheerful ray of sunshine but they have 0 clue to how severely dark and depressed i truly am i even got voted as the group cheerleader at one office because of how positive everyone thinks i am but i m actually withering inside and dying slowly i m just a former shell of myself just like in the joker movie i practice smiling in the mirror every morning to get the facial features just right so that i can flash a lovely smile each day it s gotten me good grades a few job offers kindness trust friendship from classmates and supervisors once i get home i can just slump into a dark void and remove the wooden smile that i had worn all day on my face anyone else wear masks to fit into society as well,2
I’m a massive loser,i feel like a massive loser i don t know why this happened but sometime in high school i just stopped trying in my education i don t even understand why i did everything i did i was in a pretty decent junior college but somehow couldn t motivate myself to try harder i convinced myself i wasn t smart enough and didn t even bother studying properly for my a levels and of course my shit results meant that i had to go to a private university one which doesn t need good grades to enter and definitely harder to find a job from even after entering uni i drifted through the past 2 years just barely passing every mod not doing much of anything it s not even that i was enjoying myself going out with friends or anything all i did was go some lectures leave halfway come back home and stare at my computer screen all day now i m about to be 24 years old my 2nd years about to end my gpa is about the most mediocre maybe even below average considering that all my mods are just passes there s no way i m going to be able to land a decent job i don t know why i m just realising all this now but the regret is killing me when i think about how all my peers and friends who managed to enter local u will be easily earning close to 5 digits from their first job while i m gonna be stuck at low 4 digit job it feels like a massive gut punch it feels like i was in some kind of bubble all the way till now and its finally been popped i can t see myself as anything other than a loser whose going to struggle even after entering the workforce i feel like a complete clown for throwing away my chance at a proper college life salary boost and all the prestige that comes with the local university but at this point i know that ship has already sailed and i need to find a way to improve myself and get rid of this defeatist mindset,2

What is your opinion on people who have the “bullying builds character” mentality?,have you guys ever had a partner friend or just anyone close to you in life who would say things which would severely hurt your feelings and upset you and when you spoke up about it they would tell you something along the lines of you re too sensitive or you re not gonna survive in the real world when they were aware of your mental health struggles and even when their cruel words would very obviously make things worse they would continue to disregard your feelings and act is if they re helping because they are just trying to be honest like i literally had an ex who was aware of my mental health struggles that suggested people should be more harsh towards people with mental health issues because he claimed being kind to someone with people having mental health crises and breakdowns doesn t always work,3

Bring Modesty Back,the idea of people not caring about situational awareness really takes a toll on my mental health and a lot people might hate what i m going to say but try to understand i feel like in a situation where a man gropes a woman in a bikini they re both at fault she knows she s practically half naked which is perverted and she attracts perverted behavior from another perverted person so the man acting on temptation is wrong the woman provoking the temptation is wrong and the mentality that i can walk around in anything i want because i just want to be sexy is wrong because it all comes from immodesty and it s not accidental it s intentional you know sexy means sexual it s meant to provoke sexual feelings so that s lust you can t dress yourself in lust and expect not to attract it and then push all the blame on the predator when you made yourself the bait don t get me wrong both people are responsible for their own foolish decisions but i believe more modesty will reduce any forms of sexual misconduct sidenote i want to be clear that in no way am i justifying or excusing the actions of predators or those who commit sexual assault they are fully responsible for their sin and the harm they cause this post is not about blaming victims but rather about acknowledging the responsibility we all have in our own actions including how we dress and how that can affect others the bible calls us to be mindful of how our choices can impact the people around us both in terms of their temptation and their spiritual growth this is about promoting accountability and mutual respect not shifting blame,1
Feeling like my frontal lobe is going to explode from stress,so many things have been happening lately i can only take things in small doses or i get really overwhelmed and stressed since last month it s literally been one thing after another yesterday there was a huge situation on my door step and i ve been stuck in a place i can t get out of mentally like i m stuck in that moment i can t explain it i feel like my head is going to explode from all the tension i ve paced around the house at least 100 times today and i don t feel like eating i hate this response i feel like i need to run away or something i thought about spending the night somewhere else but it s not going o solve anything i ve tried it before and when i m at a different location i m stressed about not being home is this some type of delayed flight response i feel constantly on edge and i don t know what to do tbh,1

"What’s one small thing that makes you happy, even if it’s just for a fleeting moment?",it could be the feeling of freshly washed hair a smell that comforts you laughing even if it s just at yourself hot showers or a movie you love so much it could even be ritualistic things like going out to get a cup of coffee every morning before school or work or playing on the swings at a local park every saturday i find a lot of happiness in having that sort of limp sick feeling on a foggy day i feel like a kid again on those days i can walk around the house wrapped in a fluffy blanket make a hot lemon and honey drink and eat warm chicken soup while watching the golden girls anything that makes you forget about your worries even if it isn t for that long please don t say anything like alcohol or drugs i want this to be positive,1
IOP place called dcfs on my mom for one situation that happened 8-9 years ago?? Worker also said to us she was 99% sure she would not make the call,during the evaluation to get into intensive outpatient they asked me if i ever had any physical trauma and i mentioned that like 8 9 years ago my mom kinda pulled me by the hair one time but it never happened again and my mom doesn t spank me or do anything like that anymore she told us she s 99 sure she wouldn t have to make the dcfs call yet she did it anyways she said she wouldn t say she s 99 sure if she thinks she s gonna make the call yet still did she basically lied to us i told her my home is perfectly safe and there s absolutely no reason to call dcfs i was even alone without my mom in the room if i needed help i would ve said myself even when i was alone without my mom in the room i stated that my home is safe and relationship is perfectly fine im not hit or anything like that my mom would like to know people s opinions on this situation she is incredibly upset about it it just seems like kidnapping to me to call dcfs on a kid who is clearly perfectly safe and potentially risk getting them removed from their home this seems not right at all when this was a one time thing,1

Left out at work and losing my mind,30 f i have lived in italy for 5 years and worked in my current company for 2 5 years on my first day in the office i met with my colleagues however they did not initiate any conversation except a cold welcome i had worked alone my old position was not sociable for 2 years and nothing changed i was not invited to the lunch or breaks for smoking i am a smoker also they know that and instead when i see that they are preparing to go i ask them oh you are going for lunch smoking i am coming too like a looser because i wanted to try i did not want to isolate myself i tried my best to open conversations even on nonsense topics maybe i seemed awkward i do not know my manager acted better but again from a distance he is closer with the team tho then my position was closed my manager asked me if i would consider a new position he also added that i am quiet and passive but everyone deserves a chance i answered yes of course with the new position i would improve and collaborate with the team however i just had 3 4 basic sessions of my new position and when i asked questions to one of the colleagues he told me how you do not know this what will we do with you i cannot believe and when asked my manager how to do it he explained with 2 3 sentences as i know everything my old position was a completely different and passive role when i try to do something i am judged as not knowing the business terms how should i know it is also an entry level position and no one taught me anything no shadowing no mentoring nothing also one of my colleagues told me that no one teaches job i have to learn myself but how i don t want to work because of this i can t work anyway i turn on the computer and mostly don t do anything and no one says anything to me except for the meetings i talk nonsense in performance meetings i try to say something i feel like a ghost as i have lived abroad my psychology is down now at my job i still try to do something but i am sure i seem and also i feel awkward stupid weird and depressed mentally disabled and socially awkward since i ve started 2 3 colleagues started after me but they were accepted by the people because they make jokes they are not sensitive or calm like me but rather confident funny and outgoing people i should add that no one tells me what i am doing i mean if i do not do anything it s also okay but i do not feel comfortable because i am a responsible person i am looking for a job to jump but i cannot find one i have some interviews tho i have it will be alright anyway otherwise i will be crazy i regret that i accepted the new position because i thought that it was because my old position was generally passive and now my manager acts careless answers my questions with 1 2 words that s all i think he is disappointed because he was right i asked myself if it was my mistake or not i do not know but i criticize myself too much i should also add that i have fought with social phobia since my childhood however i overcame this situation by socializing and i got better i had also used fake it until make it technique too this workplace seems to have destroyed all the social skills i had acquired and the social phobia i had fought now i am lost and i do not know what to do,1

"For anyone going through a rough time, just keep going, keep doing!",this is for the socially recluse out casts and hikkimoris if you will as someone who crushed their social anxieties over a span of 13 years the best advice i can give you is look for opportunities relationships and meaning in everything you do i promise you when you look back 5 2 1 years you will realize how much you are growing and that progress should be enough for you to convince your mind that you are a person worth saving a person worth becoming fulfilled but if you focus on your anxieties too much you bear the weight of a mental breakdown or exhaustion keep your peace the world is a complicated place just keep going we will and must be the generation that changes the world again ask any questions and i ll give my best advice,1
I NEED MENTAL HELP,i never thought i would need to resort to go to reddit for help but it s gotten to that point i m a 17 year old male doing online high school i m an only child with a single mother and i don t know who my father is since 14 i ve been thinking of ending it all but my god guided me away from that but i still can t keep this on without understanding i got into a verbal argument with my mom about me expressing how i feel it s rare for me to speak to her about it bec i don t like talking to her about these things bec she always says i m just over reacting and she just ignores me but this time i didn t stop i told her exactly how i feel and that i reflect the same way she acts to me for example when she yells at me bec i forget to wash the dishes i stay silent and look of to the distance and she yells at me more for doing that but when i told her she is doing the exact same thing to me she acts like there just complete lies i d consider myself very intelligent so i know alot of things and when i do tell her things she doesn t know she gets irritated and tells me to leave she then yells at me saying how easily school is even though she didn t go through it her self especially in these times sometimes she yells at me and says that i never tell her things but when i do she swears at me and when i was younger she used to hit me with anything she could find but she stopped now that i m much bigger and stronger than her during our argument the only thing she could say is to stop standing and go to the couch i told her no and just listen to me and i asked her out off all the things i just told you you swear at me for standing she then got so mad she took the bowl she was eating from and threw it on the ground then stormed off in a tantrum yelling that the only reason i m saying this is because she s a woman which is not true and when she said that i remembered that she probably tried to use that as an excuse bec she recently discovered tiktok and believes everything she hears i could go on and on years of story but what i just want is to know if there s anybody that has experience or understands even the slightest of what i m going through and no i dont have anybody to talk about this in real life please i need help i struggle to sleep and i m having depression,1

"Do I confront him, or move on?",my boyfriend 30m and myself 28f have been beefing about his phone he has had his phone set to dnd at night he says that he has it set on a schedule from 10pm 6am monday friday but it turns off at a different time every morning coincidentally after i leave the apartment for the day i ve tried to speak to him about this and he said that his phone automatically set up dnd hours when he hooked up his new apple watch to it but i started noticing this well after he got his watch ive tried to speak to him about this but he gaslights me saying that his phone automatically set dnd hours and that it s set on a set schedule i know both of those things to be factually inaccurate as i ve read the user guidelines to automatic setting with apple devices i ve gone through what little i can see on his apple watch and he s not getting weird phone calls or texts at strange hours and yes i ve checked at strange hours before he could have a chance to hop up and delete anything but there s nothing i know that he s manually turning off dnd and i know that your phone doesn t load push notifications while in dnd so if he s not cheating or doing anything wrong i don t understand why he d be blatantly lying to me about this it makes me feel crazy do i collect proof and evidence to confront him in order to bb get him to tell me the truth or do i just walk away any advice would be helpful,2
Unstable friend with no money needs support and is about to be alone,so a friend of mine with some family trauma and a history of depression recently went on a trip with his long term gf that triggered something and he has been having a ton of manic episodes the past week not sleeping etc hes always been pretty normal when i ve known and lived with him i haven t seen him but have been hearing from his roommates my friend and his gf some wild stuff anyway it s to the point where he s in a 72hr holding facility and now his gf and one other roommate are coming to stay with me bc they don t feel safe the other roomie is on vacation for 2 weeks to add to this he lost his job is broke and everyone but the vacation guy is about to stop paying rent for right now basically this leaves me as his one point of contact and person of support since she can t anymore he s probably getting out tomorrow and he s gonna be at that house by himself with no one there and no money he has a van he can live in if it comes to it i took all of his guns he s a gun enthusiast ofc from that house and am planning to stash them with someone else i m kind of at a loss of what to do for him and where he s gonna be able to get support he has no insurance and can t afford acute care from what i ve researched i m also a little concerned about him showing up to my house now and don t know if i should tell him they re staying with me and that i have his guns if i lie there s a good chance he ll find out anyway and then he won t trust me anymore i m just generally concerned about having sorta just seized his personal firearms tbh i can only hope he regains his bearings before he s evicted but idk he has a brother in another state but that s it any ideas thanks,1
I want advice on dealing with my brother's condition,it may seem very formal because chat gpt helped but it is a bit professional summary of the case the person is a 21 year old male single and a university student but has no specific career interests he is calm and rational neither highly spontaneous nor overly analytical he prefers isolation and finds it difficult to express his emotions however he prioritizes his family although he struggles with forgiveness even toward close family members he only deeply cares about two people he has no real friendships and even if he forms one he remains emotionally independent he expresses love by allowing someone to stay close and share emotions with him while his anger manifests as shouting criticism or rejection he does not initiate conflicts but will engage if others provoke them he regrets falling behind in his studies but was never bullied or severely criticized in fact people tend to like him despite his introverted nature he fears failure and stagnation in life and is influenced by others opinions even if he hides it he tends to overthink but within a closed loop this state began around two years ago his negative thoughts are triggered by discussions about his current situation finances or beliefs he finds it difficult to express them and only shares with one person his behavior has changed leading to isolation loss of motivation and increased irritability he also blames himself for repeatedly failing to quit a bad habit recently he started feeling like he is going to die or that someone will kill him he also believes that all people are his enemies these thoughts are reinforced by past conflicts and he fears that those people might seek revenge on him he sees migration as his only solution or at least a partial one as it would help him escape his current environment and past experiences discussion questions how can one handle such overwhelming emotions and negative thoughts could these symptoms be linked to a specific psychological disorder what steps can be taken to support him without adding pressure are there similar experiences and how were they managed thank you,1
My ex seems to be stalking me again and I’m so anxious,idk what else to say friends there s a long backstory he s not a safe or stable person i m too exhausted and simultaneously anxious to go through it and i m not sure what kind of supportive words people would even be able to give over this but yeah i just can t fucking stop my heart from racing and i m so shaky,1
I have never felt more alone,i ve felt like wanting to kill my self for a while though ik i m too scared to do it i feel alone rn more than ever i have no one to talk to,0
I think I might be paranoid,i m under the constant assumption that people want to hurt me or are out to get me that they re planning to do something terrible and are waiting for me to let my guard down so that i m vulnerable i know that s not true that i probably just have some sort of paranoia it s just that every once in a while someone i consider to be a close friend proves me right deepening my delusions because of this i m pretty much incapable of bonding with others it s like a never ending cycle of deterioration i hate people i hate them so much i don t think i really mean that but that s how i feel at this very moment people make me sick to my stomach i don t want them near me i don t want them to touch me or talk to me but i feel so lonely because of it i hate being alone but the other option is just too scary to consider i can t remember the last time that i ve tried to make a friend i don t know what ll destroy me first the loneliness or people,1
seeing people with completely different faces for small periods of time and it's terrifying,hi i m not sure if this is mental illness or what but it really freaks me out and it s been going on for a while now and i can t figure out what triggers it or how to stop it sometimes when i am hanging out with a friend one on one for a while after a few hours of being together i will no longer recognize the face in front of me it will look like a completely different person to me like a total stranger even though i know it s my friend and their voice is the same it s extremely terrifying and i am always freaked out when it happens it usually takes about 5 10 minutes for their face to go back to normal but by then my friend can tell something is wrong and i don t want to tell them and freak them out too they don t look like monsters or demons or anything just a completely different person it happens the most in low lighting if i have had a drink or two and also when i m kissing someone but it happens even without any of that it happens with both my closest and dearest friends and complete strangers like on a date or something if anyone knows what this is please let me know,1

Tell me that things do get better,i am 24f so far i have had a rough patch but did my best to get out of it each time last year i finished a useless humanities degree but i thought it is better than a 4 year gap with small job experience and right now i am at an internship which will go for a year and originally i had a plan to go back to uni for a year to try out being a librarian because i have always loved books but my mother talked me out of it because she didn t want me to waste my time because like with any other profession it is not 100 certain so after that i will probably look for anything that covers my bills and all but what i aim with this post i just need to know that it won t be this way forever i hate living in the prison that is my mind,6

Why is mental health so disregarded?,i was supposed to start a new job today and a day before i started getting old anxiety and panic issues reappearing because of a housing situation that only gives me 9 months to find a job that pays enough money and also find an apartment to move to so my parents don t get kicked out of theirs this new job which does not pay nearly enough to live on my own asked me if this was going to be a common problem and if it was they were not gonna hire me any ideas what to be doing until my therapy appointment in a couple days,1

I have no reason to be alive,i just don t have a reason being told that some stranger on the internet cares won t help either so save your condolences i am so over worked and i get nothing for it i m tired of school i m tired of pressure and i hate everyone and everything surrounding me every day is the same draining mundane process and it ll never get better reframing my mentality doesn t help years of counseling and antidepressants haven t helped whatsoever and have arguably made things worse and most of my friends don t care and the few that do are insufferable and i hate listening to them including my boyfriend i am a miserable insufferable piece of trash and i want to end it all just so i don t have to deal with any of it it ll never get better i guess this post is somewhat of a cry for help or one last reach to find some reason to go on because i can t find one i ve always been told things just happen you ll find your reason or things tend to work themselves out but all the god damn time it s beaten again and again into my head that those are lies it only gets worse you can only enjoy the little things so many times before you need to accept your situation otherwise it s just madness i have no reason not to do it anymore other than the same handful of fallacies people in charge or people pretending to care say it s about the little things just make it to the end of the day that s all that matters right now shit like that makes me so angry because it s all lies,0

What could this be?,sometimes i get this weird almost indescribable feeling that i ve had on and off since i was about 4 or 5 it s not exactly bad but not good either it s just off like a strange mix of detachment nostalgia and something almost sad but not quite the first time i remember feeling it i was leaning over the handlebars of a trampoline as a kid and i kept leaning over again and again just to make myself feel it it s not necessarily tied to that memory but i remember that moment so clearly because it was the first time i ever noticed it over the years it s popped up randomly usually when i m leaning in a weird position or more recently when i m out in the sun i started taking pictures when i felt it trying to find a pattern and the only real correlation i can see is that it tends to happen on sunny days usually around the start or end of the day recently i ve noticed it happening when i m out having fun with people i love like when i was on a nice walk with my boyfriend or hanging out with friends it s a fleeting sensation only lasting a few minutes at most but when it s there i feel oddly disconnected like my brain is touching something just out of reach i ve thought about what it could be and maybe it s some kind of subconscious nostalgia but for a feeling rather than a memory or maybe it s a sensory trigger like my brain recognizing the combination of sunlight movement and atmosphere and linking it back to something from when i was younger it could even be a bit of sunset anxiety since it often happens at transitional times of the day i don t know if it s a form of mild dissociation a weird emotional imprint or just some random brain glitch but whatever it is it s been following me for years and i still don t fully understand it does anyone else ever get similar feelings,1

People are horrible for my mental health,i believe the lens i see the world through is not the same compared to other people i ve always thought loving was very selfish whatever type of relationship it is you love a dog it s because you re either emotionally in need of giving back or it s adorable you love a person because they give something to you that you need everybody is selfish and i don t think this should be the way but i don t know how else it could be nor it is in my hands people are very selfish they want to hurt other people that are innocent because of insecurities or trauma to pass down i don t want to be around people we use each other to feel better i wish it wasn t this way i don t see a point in improving myself because i don t want fake people what i mean is people only want the better version of you and won t love you unless you can give back i don t support nor understand this type of relationship can someone please help me with my way thinking,1
I'm emotionally abusing my friend,i know the title sounds bad but just listen i ve been struggling for years now and i honestly shouldn t be alive a reason for this is mainly my paranoia and lately its been based around thoughts that someone i know is gonna die and i have to save them and stuff and somedays it s manageable and other days it s really bad and i just breakdown in fear i know that it s all in my head but when i think of it it feels soo real this and thoughts of ending it makes me extremely moody and out of it somedays like i don t want to speak to anyone and i lash out at people cuz i don t trust anyone and i think they re murderers and stuff soo back to the title she came up yo me and said i think i m in an emotionally abusive relationship like everything we do depends on they re mood if they re having a bad day then we both have a bad day but like the good days are really good but the bad days are also really really bad and i really love this person soo what they say really matters i just don t know what to do and then i said i didn t know what to do either and then she told me that the person she was talking about was me and i just awkwardly giggled i don t talk to people about my problems cuz again i don t trust people and the people around me don t understand me either it always feels like there s a language barrier between me and everyone else and i how could i talk about my feelings when it s either i feel nothing or i feel sad and angry and i know my sob story doesn t justify my actions but i just don t know what to do i care about her soo much but i just can t bring my self to tell her everything i m soo sick of being the person that i am and i m soo tired of hurting people i hate myself soo much for this how many other people feel like this i really want to fix myself and if i could then i would but i can t and i really am trying someone please give me advice,1

"I'm told that human connection, social and/or physical, is a need. But it also isn't owed to anyone. Is it right to call it a need in the same way we call water and food and shelter a need then? My mental health would be better with it, but it's not something I can demand. I must be better for it.",i might like a hug but i can t demand one nor expect one to be given i d like people to talk to me in person or on social media but i must be a good enough person first to earn such a need being met obviously boundaries must be respected just makes meeting social needs more complicated and confusing aspergers autism and all,3

planning to break contact with my family,hi guys ever since childhood my dad s philosophy inherited from his shitty soviet parents was that you should treat own children like shit and not be vulnerable with them but thankfully our mother had her own views as the result we established emotional bond with mom while having a guard up with our father however things took a terrible turn when he made our mom birth third child while soviet grandfather started living with us and life became so stressful for her that she started to disassociate obsessed with control my dad started taking advantage of her disassociation in darkest ways possible he plays a role of a frustrated person who was always right but never listened to and by playing this role he either makes my mom doubt herself and her decisions or at least he makes her believe that he cares about these things whatsoever the truth is he never gave a fck about any of the things he is arguing about and still doesn t he is just trying to gain control through this role but here s where it gets difficult for me is by time my mom breaks and is in such condition where she could attack anyone and blame it onto the person who she is attacking i understand that this is because she is living in such hazardous environment where this kind of serves as her way to protect herself but when she does it with me it absolutely destroys me over time my mother s emotional state has become so fragile that if i try to address what s really going on she denies it and sometimes lashes out at me believing i m adding another headache to her life my brother who i raised basically and was best buds with betrayed me used my trust played mind games on me for years and if i spoke up he would punish me by putting mom against me he planted seeds of doubt in my mom s mind against what i was saying and also tried to make me doubt her which i soon realized but still if i spoke up my dad would start to blame me instead of my brother the most devastating part was to see them making my mother doubt me in that situation where i was the one mindfcked by my brother regardless of the numerous abuse i ve received which was especially painful when received through my mother i ve stayed so far because i love her it was never about responsibility or obligation it was about love i always reminded myself that staying was my choice even when it meant facing the toxicity but now i ve reached a point where i recognize that this choice is costing me my own life and well being leaving feels like an irreversible decision and i know that once i move out my father and brother will intensify their manipulation my sister who is also struggling decided to stay here for some time so this might worsen things as well because sometimes my dad tries to provoke her and if she snaps he uses this to convince my mom that both me and my sister are crazy and ungrateful numerous times i ve tried my best to prevent this supported my sister and made sure she would use healthy ways of communication but once i m not here i know they will provoke her to lash out and then things are going to be twisted and re written worst case scenario my entire years of hard effort could be portrayed to be unnecessary re labeling my conversations with my mother from helpful to problematic as if there weren t any problems ever and i were the crazy one i m seeking advice on how to handle the process of cutting ties or any practical tips,2

How do I talk to my sister about getting help?,my family has a history of something we all nicknamed it the rage my grandmother had it then my dad and now my sister it aligns a lot with bipolar we refer to my sister as the wild card meaning you don t really know how she will react in situations or at events sometimes she s totally fine other times she is off the wall she drinks a lot talks a lot and fast she can be very reckless and manic her most significant issue is her addiction to the shittiest men she goes from one abusive man to another she is currently dating an unemployed man with five kids and three baby mamas who all claim they are still sleeping with him but that s a different story my sister works full time as a nurse and then spends her free time caring for her boyfriend and his kids cooking cleaning etc you name it her blind codependency on these crappy men is something else they abuse her take advantage of her labour and finances etc i recently tried to talk to her about it i told her it could benefit her to speak to a doctor and end this generational curse i expected her to be upset but i hoped she would put aside the stigma about this topic but she lost her mind on me she went off saying her depression sadness is just her difficult life and will go away when things get better she starts attacking me about things she knows i am sensitive about and then calls our other family members to tell them how awful i am to say such a thing as mentioned before my whole family knows about the rage and they also know about her being the wild card so it s not a surprise that i broached the subject but she is so mad at me now i was going to send her an apology this morning but instead she sent me a cruel email so i don t think she is in the space to hear from me at the moment is it worth ever mentioning again like the generations before us i think i will continue to sweep it under the rug,1
I need help finding what my feeling is called.,ever since i was born i hated when others tried fixing things my way after not going well for me i hate it when people behave in a forced way to appeal to me out of pity like being given an award when normally i shouldn t have even if i deserved it i will give some examples because it is hard to explain with words as a kid i was homeschooled for english my brother and i competed on who gets to the room faster to win a mr crabs sticker for good performance my brother cheated in the race by pushing me aside or something and won i got frustrated but then the teacher felt bad and wanted to give it to me instead i didn t want it i had lost because the decision was made i don t want to recall other examples to not reopen wounds so i will continue with theoretical ones if i felt left out in a group then people noticed that and everyone tried to show care my sadness would convert to anger if i needed help with something and nobody aproached me then eople notice how i feel and everyone jumps on me to help i would feel offended depending on how important the situation would be i would accept for example if it is a matter of passing a class in uni i would take the help but still annoyed for not getting the help earlier if it was for something trivial that i could manage on my own i would be pissed if somebody treated me awfully and then learnt how i felt and say things like i m sorry i didn t know that would piss me off if the person came and said i feel like i am being rude towards you if you feel that was i m sorry i accept that as a kind gesture i have seen it this kind of behavior a lot people being considerate only when it is too late or too late for them to realize on their own or out of pity is there a name of this kind of feeling or is it something unique to me i hope i am in the right sub,2

mental health support,hi everyone it s the first time i ve used reddit but i did it for a very specific reason first of all i m a minor and i don t want to say my age but i still go to high school i would really like to receive psychological support i have always struggled to admit it but i feel more and more overwhelmed by everything inside i tell myself that it s nothing and i m probably dramatic but at the same time i suffer from constant mood swings first i feel like everything is fine and then i even struggle to get out of bed i have done various tests online and many suggest that i suffer to a greater or lesser extent from depression social anxiety and eating disorders i feel really disconnected from everything and what hurts the most is that i have no one to talk to about it that actually makes me feel better i don t have a family just my mother with whom i have a difficult relationship and i have no friends as much as i try and as much as i want i have never found anyone to whom i am special but i don t mean a false friendship but a true and profound one because of my family problems i also always had financial problems such as sometimes my mother didn t have enough money to buy me food and i feel like that gets in the way of making friends too i mean the kids around me have a lot of things that they take for granted that i never had and that s not even all i have a lot of things to say i have never talked about my trauma so now i feel like i need someone with i can share it feeling understood i would also like to talk to a specialist but i have no money and my mother is against it anyway i live in a small town so i don t have many other options so i m here my school doesn t offer any kind of support and there isn t much interest in adolescent mental health any suggestions,0
