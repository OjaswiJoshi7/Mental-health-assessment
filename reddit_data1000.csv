I Survived a Genocide But I Feel Nothing,i managed to evacuate from gaza leaving behind the rubble the bodies and the memories of the war zone you d think getting out would bring relief a sense of safety but all it brought me was emptiness i thought once i escaped i d be able to feel again to grieve for the lives lost for the people i knew but i feel nothing i m in a place far from the violence now surrounded by people who are living normal lives they go about their day complaining about trivial things traffic their jobs relationship problems and i just stare at them how do they not realize how absurd it all is i survived hell saw children torn apart in the streets watched families disappear overnight and now i m expected to care about small talk i don t even after i got out people wanted me to share my story to talk about the horrors i escaped but every time i do i feel detached like i m telling someone else s story i describe the destruction the bodies the screams but it feels like i m reading from a script i can tonnect to it anymore it s like i left my emotions back there buried under the rubble i ve lost all sense of empathy when i hear about someone dying even someone close it doesn t register i didn t cry when i found out a friend of mine didn t make it out i didn t care when i heard about others losing everything i go through the motions pretending to sympathize but inside it s just blank people think escaping the genocide means survival but it s not true part of me died there and the part that made me human never made it out now when i see images of what s still happening or hear about others struggles i can t bring myself to feel anything i walk past people begging for help and i feel no urge to stop i m broken in ways no one can see on the outside i m functioning i smile i work i talk to people but inside i m just as destroyed as the streets i left behind it s been 5 months,1100,118,175.0429879
My Dad shot himself today..,i don t know where else to put this but i need to get it out today my dad killed himself he had been battling depression for a long time today he got way too drunk he was a recovering alcoholic and got in to a big argument with my mom they were fighting on the front porch while i was in the kitchen making a bottle for my 8 mo son who was sleeping in his crib on the other side of the house after they were arguing my dad walked in to the house shut his bedroom door and shot himself in the head i was right outside the door when it happened and i can t get the sound out of my head luckily my son slept through the whole thing and was quickly taken out of the house by his father while i called 911 my eyes hurt but i can t sleep or close them with out everything replaying through my head i feel like my life is in pieces and i don t know what to do that s all i can really say if you need help please get it because of a horrible combination of alcohol guns and depression my son no longer has the grandpa that he so much adored and i am now with out a dad edit thank you all so much for all the sentiments i know it s strange to post something so personal to random people but hearing from all of you makes me feel less alone i guess i 100 agree about therapy and i am definitely no stranger to it and the help it gives sadly money is tight and my insurance is shit so if anyone has any resources to help me find a cheaper solution when it comes to therapy i would be very grateful,1066,79,1681.486171

Depression does NOT mean feeling sad. Depression is a medical term for functioning below necessary levels,depression and it s synonym suppression are commonly used in medical treatment and diagnosis to indicate something is wrong and the affected system can t adequately contribute to the rest of the body so basically you can t think and act in a way that keeps up with your obligations so it s not just feeling sadness it s not laziness and it s not for the sake of gaining attention if some was experiencing respiratory depression would you say ok but have you tried breathing more no then cynics and doubters can fuck off ok i m done p s treatment helps depression it really does,992,83,2170.189215

I think that ‚Äú13 reasons why‚Äù is a very bad way of ‚Äúspreading awareness‚Äù,as the title suggests i think that 13rw is a very bad portrayal of mental health suicide depression etc and it shouldn t be promoted as a show that raises awareness when it s just harmful it portrays suicide as something beautiful and meaningful and not what it really is and the whole blame it on other people even though they tried to help me thing nope nope nope that s so toxic idk if i just feel that way because of my ptsd an older guy blamed me for his suicide attempt because i didn t help him enough even though i did everything i could and was only 13 but it s just not really how suicide should be portrayed in my opinion also the way they show flashbacks of hannah baker from when she was alive makes it seem like she s still alive in some way they reeeeally push this harmful suicide is something you choose as a weapon to hurt other people agenda when in reality suicide is often the exact opposite idk personally i really don t like that show and i think it s harmful i once opened up about my suicidal thoughts and depression to a friend and she was all like who made you feel that way like it was other people s fault like sure trauma and toxic relationships with people can worsen suicidal thoughts and depression but i just don t feel like the show portrayed it in a helpful way,928,109,1765.241194

"Just had my cousin's memorial on Zoom, and it was atrocious.",my cousin recently killed herself we were close when we were growing up her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her expectations she obviously felt she couldn t meet i m pissed off because in her memorial not once did they mention it was a suicide the closest thing i could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online where they said she succumbed to the pressures of covid 19 which is the most bullshit way to sugar coat a suicide they could ve come up with as someone who has been very very close to taking my own life having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didn t happen just sang songs about god beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to heaven and not hell even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed sin no recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life i posted on her memorial site just a quick blurb of some memories i had with her a nice photo of us when we were young and i quick sentence at the end basically saying some of us face our struggles silently and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone whether they ask for it or not and i linked nami and the suicide hotline they fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out they reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in i m honestly appalled they seem embarrassed and ashamed of her and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the eyes of god fuck man wouldn t even let a supportive message and a link to nami slip in there had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever i feel so bad for her if her parents made me feel this invalidated in one fell swoop i can t imagine what her life was like with them just needed to vent thanks for reading,901,101,1550.757282

It really annoys me when people mock your mental illness in private.

Adopted a cat during quarantine and it is unbelievable how our bond together has helped ease the pains of isolation.,so long story short a couple months ago i was losing my mind feeling trapped inside my apartment with very little to do like many of you probably it was just me and my roommate going about our usual routine and life just seemed so bleak then my friend asked if i could babysit his kitten and it was a game changer i found out cuddling nuzzling feeding and caring for a cat was so rewarding and realized how special the bond between cats and humans are so i adopted my own kitten a few weeks later and we fell instantly in love with each other i have so much time to appreciate the little moments between us to watch him grow and to witness our bond grow stronger everyday because we spend so much time together not only that but i feel more confident in reaching out to my friends and family on social media phone again because i don t feel alone anymore i would say if you are feeling alone or you are looking for a sense of purpose during this time i highly recommend getting a pet because this is a rare occasion where your bond with your pet will be stronger than ever if you want to follow my cat on ig i post almost every day and you can watch him grow too finn_the_feline_ _ _ tldr adopted a cat during quarantine and our bond continues to grow rapidly day by day very rewarding experience and eases the pains of quarantine,701,99,1576.167468

Things that I didn't realize were anxiety,feeling unable and too afraid to speak up not wanting to come off as stupid feeling like i had to overachieve and be the best at everything to be considered intelligent incessantly criticizing myself thinking everyone could see inside my head and them realizing that i didn t belong there thinking i had to be perfect to avoid judgement resenting myself for not living up to everyone s standards,675,57,2329.717873

Suicide hotlines are useless for people struggling with mental illness,as somebody who has called a suicide hotline at least 6 times in the past none of the operators were helpful at that point i gave up calling those hotlines these people are not trained mental health professionals so they don t really know what to say they are just trained to listen and answer with i m sorry you are going through that and do you think there s anything you could do to lessen those thoughts and it must be so hard for you and do you have a plan it s literally the same phrases every time it s like they are a bunch of robots so goddamn repetitive and predictable if i wanted to hear those phrases over and over i could literally type them into siri or something basically they just want to offer you some sympathy people who are actually suicidal don t want your sympathy,653,113,1628.954216
There should be a psychiatrist instead of a school councillors to talk to students about their mental health.,i am a teen and the school councillor i talked about my mental health with basically just told me that my grades are good so i don t need to worry about it and that there many other students like me even in my own class turns out i did need to worry about it because i had depression and by ignoring it only got worse and also how is knowing that other people feel like shit to supposed to help that just upset me even more i get knowing that i am not alone helps but if half the people in my school are depressed there might just be a problem with the school edit thanks to everyone who responded i have a psychiatrist therapist now i don t really know the difference since english isn t my native language i would like to say that i am not from the usa i m from belgium still thanks for your advice because a lot of it still applies here and they might have helped someone from the usa i also would like to say that i don t hate my school councillor but that her advice was just bad and that i just wish that a mental health professional talked to me earlier here is some mental health help for if you live in belgium flanders i don t how it is for wallonia it s mainly focused on teens and kids you can anonymously cal text send them an email or post something on the forum suicide hot line belgium 1813,656,101,1631.005142

People should get mental health checkups,we get our blood checked every so often our whole body looked over every year or two and if you re an older guy the doctor even sticks his finger up your butt to check your prostate but nobody ever thought to go for random mental health checks to see if they might be depressed or anxious and not know it i tried to kill myself and honestly didn t believe that i was depressed so you can certainly have something going on mentally and be totally unaware go get checked out,648,44,1584.484066

Tik Tok psychologists are the absolute worst,i absolutely hate the so called psychologists on tik tok and instagram they often take general things that could apply to almost anyone and try to claim they re a result of mental illness they ll title a video something like 10 signs you might have bipolar and then list things like you like to hang out with friends sometimes but others you prefer to spend time to yourself or its hard for you to stay focused on just one hobby plus they have a bad habit of labelling everything as a trauma response you re a picky eater trauma you get nervous around crowds trauma theyll even say that pretending to have trauma is a sign of trauma it seriously pisses me off because what they re doing is causing great harm to those who actually struggle with mental health it delegitimizes the experiences of those with mental illness and it makes a lot of people assume that mental illness aren t actually too big a struggle to have,625,90,1073.040316

My mother having sex with me in the same room damaged my relationship with sex,when i was about 10 years old my parents split up and my mom got with her current boyfriend ever since i could remember i would hear them having sex at night while they thought i was sleeping we went through a lot of houses in the time this happened i m currently 17 and the first time i recall hearing her doing this was when we lived with my aunt shortly after my parents broke up and i shared a room with my mom she would almost every night have sex and i would have to sit there for what felt like hours covering my ears then we eventually started living in a camper and it would happen so much the whole camper would shake and all i would hear was the noises now we live in a house and at least we have our own rooms but i still hear them because the walls are so thin and they leave the door open i bring this up because i cannot and never have been able to have a healthy sexual relationship with myself without thinking of them having sex the noises and the shaking i just wanted to tell this on here because this is the only way i feel like i can anonymously say it and i just want some help because it still happens to this day and i just wonder if it s trauma or if i m just being overly dramatic edit i would also like to add i know it is my mom s right to have sex i know it s natural but i just don t like hearing it edit 2 thank you all for the kind words you are all so sweet and helpful,612,75,513.0272717

I feel bad for my cat because we don‚Äôt have a routine anymore.,when i had a predictable schedule my cat would make sure i followed it to the letter every morning he woke me up right before my alarm so there was time for me to pet him then would hop off and meow until i got out of bed then led me to the bathroom and would wait on top of the toilet until i was done showering if i took longer than ten minutes he d start meowing then he d sit on top of my counter and watch me brush my teeth and try to grab the floss as i was using it then he would hop down and strut in front of me looking behind to make sure i was following and lead me to my bag once i picked up my bag he d lead me downstairs to the kitchen he would then sit on one of the chairs and watch me cook and eat breakfast and when i was getting all ready to leave he would wait for me to walk over and pet him goodbye for the day when i got home he d be waiting for me he d lead me back upstairs and stand in the spot my bag s supposed to go then we d play fetch with toy balls and i d give him lots of pets until we tired out then i would get on the computer for work and games and he d hop into his cat bed nearby and fall asleep when it was time for bed he sometimes even got up to lead me to the bathroom and make sure i was brushing my teeth then go back to bed since the pandemic started i ve had nowhere to go nothing to do and even several months later i can tell he misses the routine he still tries to wake me up on time he s been trying different tactics the most effective one so far seems to be bringing a toy and doing cuddle rolls just out of reach of the bed so i have to get up to pet him he still meows if i m in the shower for more than ten minutes when i do finally go downstairs he rushes ahead of me halfway down and leads me the rest of the way he frequently makes circles around my feet as i m on the computer asking for pets and playtime it breaks me heart when he does these things i know he s trying so hard literally the most caring individual when it comes to me taking care of myself is my cat but lot of his effort goes in vain and it wracks me with guilt and appreciation every morning to watch him try,584,19,1637.376635
Some random guy saved my life today and he didn‚Äôt even realize it,so i hit rock bottom months ago but i brought a shovel with me and i ve been getting worse and worse i wrote my suicide note this morning and my plan was to take my pistol and end it all tonight when i got home from work i had everything planned and i was set then this evening i was at work delivering pizzas i went to this one house and i wasn t sure if i was at the right address or not but there was a man in the driveway and i asked him if i was at the right address he said he wasn t sure because it was his bosses house not his and he was only there to pick up his car then we started talking and he mentioned how i was smiling he spoke about how he was 63 years old he was a military veteran and how with people my age he doesn t see people smile like i did it was a fake smile i put on so when i greet customers it s a good experience but he picked up on my smile we chatted and he was making me laugh he ended up giving me a big hug and was telling me how i should appreciate my friends my family and life this guy had no clue i was depressed and suicidal and was planning on taking my life 3 hours later yet he still told me all of this he ended up giving me some cheese he had i didn t eat it but the reason why he gave it to me is because the packaging had a huge smile on it and he told me to have it and to keep on smiling and spreading positivity this guy was only at the house to pick up his car he was only there for 5 minutes yet in that 5 minutes is when i showed up if that delivery was 5 minutes earlier or 5 minutes later i would have already taken my life but the timing was perfect and i m still here i m not a super religious person but i truly believe this man was my saving grace he was sent by god to let me know it s not my time to go i gotta keep fighting i got his bosses phone number from the side of the work truck that was sitting in the driveway and i plan on calling him tomorrow and letting him know this story and asking him to thank his employee for me god is real and he sent this man to save my life,587,48,781.8821805
Ever stay asleep because dreams are more attractive than reality?,i ve noticed that since the beginning of the pandemic i ve been prone to staying in bed asleep much longer than before and it s because the life i m living in my dreams is significantly more interesting and satisfying than the one i m living in real life just seems like such a weird idea to me but it s plain as day,582,66,1665.106937

"i completely shut down and suddenly ""ghost"" other people when i get hit by depressive episodes",most of the time i feel really anxious and depressed but when it gets to a particularly suffocating point i completely bail on other people i come around after a few days or week though i do this quite a lot and i m afraid it s becoming pretty toxic and unfair to my friends and support networks but i can t help it because i m too scared to pull them in with me i know that they might get tired of me always being such a downer and constantly feeling like this i haven t even replied to my boyfriend in days and i think i ve also triggered him because i keep seeing him post sad depressing stuff online i ve been feeling the need to isolate even more because the of many problems and the quarantine isn t making it any better i hate that i feel this way and always thinking that isolation is the key but i m really convinced that it s much more harmful if they see me in such a state because it s really hard to deal with a person with mental illness es i just want myself to stop doing this but i can t help it,579,40,1768.091266

"Just because some people don't make a scene of their mental disorders, doesn't mean they aren't struggling",just because some people don t look or act mentally ill that doesn t mean they don t have a problem going on if they are trying hard to hide it it s possible they re struggling more since they have to hold it in also if someones symptoms don t seem as severe as your own that doesn t mean they don t have a problem and therefore aren t entitled to get help kids shouldn t need to come out about being depressed by attempting suicide because they have no other way to prove it s a real problem that they deal with and they definitely shouldn t have to go as far as to commit suicide to show they ve struggled x200b i want people to get help without being told their ocd is for attention and that their depression is just an excuse to be lazy their anxiety is just an excuse to avoid doing things or their adhd is just an excuse to misbehave if people are so worried over others faking this stuff for pity then maybe don t give them pity and that s the problem solved then instead of giving them the things you think they re faking problems to get try to push them to see professional help and leave it at that instead of going out of your way to make it worse for them x200b nobody should be allowed to do terrible things and get away with it by blaming their disorder i get that if someone you know is doing that treat it like the law does don t punish or hate them but maybe send them to a psych ward to get help if they truthfully are harming others because they can t control themselves x200b if anyone out there is afraid to come out about a struggle of theirs because they re afraid of being called an attention seeker don t hold back because of people like this know that bottling it up will make it worse over time tell someone that will understand maybe a school psychologist or a doctor before it becomes too severe to fix easily once you do that it will be so much easier,574,33,2255.779056
This sub is toxic‚Ä¶,sorry to say this but the amount of i m going to kill myself or i m going to self harm myself over insert phrase is too much this sub is for ranting and asking for help people who need that help i feel should be welcomed and helped out but if someone is actually to the point where they might end their life and they are looking for help and all they see is people talking about killing themselves or self harming that will only make it worse for them i found this sub to maybe rant or get advice on how to better myself but a majority of the posts i ve seen are just people saying they are going to end it or asking how they should do it no disrespect to anyone who has made these posts but i feel like this is anti what this sub is for i feel like mods should consider this as well and i think it would make it better for those needing real advice maybe i m wrong and i m just looking at this from my view but i just feel like we can do better for this sub and for those who are in a crisis let me know what your guy s opinions are i hope i m not being insensitive,575,163,1192.049449

I learned an important lesson from my therapist about healing.,at the end of our hour she told me that although i ve been hurt and broken badly she can see i still have parts that aren t shattered i laughed lightly and i said yeah one day that will be all of me no parts shattered anymore and she said no it won t and for a second i felt my heart break but she continued but it will be the most dominant part of you think of your body if you break your shoulder even after it heals it will be tender it will be a sore spot you will be careful with it there will be a gentleness when you care for it if you crack a rib laughing will hurt and even after there is no longer a fracture you may laugh lighter just in case you can heal but it is okay to be aware of the parts of you that once hurt the most the most important thing to know is that where there is tenderness let there be gentleness,569,33,2200.324009

Is depression actually just a heightened awareness of the pointlessness of life?,something that often comes to mind it s common for a lot of people suffering with depression to feel that life is pointless and a waste of time when i think about it the only logical purpose to our existence is to procreate which arguably could be seen as pointless as it s ultimately unfulfillable this train of thought always leads me to the same answer which is that my depression isn t caused by some sort of chemical imbalance or poor circumstances but the understanding that my life is in fact pointless is this shared and if so how do you overcome or bypass these thoughts to allow a productive life,571,98,1394.359241

Anyone else think Instagram is so toxic for mental health?,of course the main problem with instagram and mental health is the fake lifestyles which people see everyday but i find i also hate most of the things i see on instagram about mental health every day i see posts making anxiety seem like a trendy thing to have and making it seem like overcoming depression is a necessary factor of a success story and the amount of times i ve seen people sharing posts about mental health on their stories or pages things like make sure you check up on your friends now i don t know about you but practically none of the people who post things like that i have had check on me whether in person or over message and nor have i seen them check on others makes me think that all these kind of posts are a way of creating an even more ideal image of ones self purely for social acceptance,565,86,1429.333812

You don't need to have a crazy story to be valid,i have had an insane life full of dark trauma abuse alcoholism suicide despair extreme loss stalking harassment and destitution for years i wanted to die and i begged my mother for permission to die to end my suffering i literally got my brain zapped 14 times to fight it ect is actually very safe and effective for severe treatment resistant depression but all those labels don t matter so let me tell you a few things 1 your suffering is as equally valid as mine 2 everything is relative you can have an amazing life and still be suffering 3 your suffering does not need justification you feel what you feel screw invalidating statements like it s just hormones 4 we all have our own journey don t compare your life struggles to those of others 5 you deserve growth as a human being even if you don t feel like you do our illnesses cloud our perspective of the past present and future 6 don t believe everything you think 7 there is no cure suffering is part of human existence and by learning to accept it and sit with it we can overcome it p s now i have more happy days than depressed days it took awhile and i never thought i would get here but i am so thankful i am much better person for it,570,24,1657.064704
Would someone take the time to wish me a happy birthday? I don't have anyone and don't want to feel so alone today.,today is my birthday and this sounds pretty sad but i just want someone to wish me a happy birthday and maybe say something nice i no longer have any friends or family left and just want some sort of human connection even if it is just over reddit to make me feel just a bit less isolated and forgotten i have just endured so much lately and i don t have anyone to talk to or confide in but i thought i could make it through today just fine i was wrong i feel stupid and pitiful while i m typing this but i just want to know someone is out there and understands getting to this point happened without me even realizing how solitary i had become until i was completely alone i might as well lay it out as just the act of typing it might be some sort of catharsis so how did i end up here i started typing out damn near my whole life story but that made this post so long that if i left it included there was an even smaller chance someone would read this so highlights then abandoned by parents raised by grandparents abused by neighbor from ages 5 to 8 horrible abandonment issues started getting into drugs dropped out of high school got a ged some life happened was totally goth some more life happened made some music and art now only goth on the inside started college got married wife left and grandparents arrested institutionalized due to alzheimer s dementia in the same weekend abruptly left college to move home to sort everything out oh hey drugs slowly watched my only family deteriorate before my eyes until they didn t even recognize me any longer raging heroin addiction to try not to feel any of this grandfather died got in trouble with the law lost everything i owned homeless junkie interlude lost almost 3 years of my life in jail prison over less than 4 000 worth of bad checks oops can t get a decent job due to criminal record congestive heart failure almost die start getting my life back together meet a nice girl

deal of time it is difficult without proper access to the doctors i need but i m getting there i ve also been clean for 4 years and i m never going back to that dependence never before in my life did i ever feel like i was completely done with drugs but this time it has really stuck haven t even had any cravings and now it never even crosses my mind i m finally in a good and stable place in my recovery now i have other issues though poverty is very real the threat of eviction looms nearly every month being able to afford the 12 different prescriptions i take is really hard and i find myself cutting pills in half because even 70 a month for medicine is a real challenge i was able to get enrolled back in college and that is the plan of how to survive until i graduate and find work i m physically able to handle i m working towards a career in counseling because i want to be able to use all of these nightmare experiences to help other people i want to use what time i have left on this planet to help others and hopefully leave it better than i found it that is how you end up alone on your 40th birthday typing on an ancient laptop that you pray survives a couple more months until you transfer schools and can get a replacement with financial aid funds my family died drugs pushed everyone away for years except other drug addicts and an addict isn t anyone s friend i am no longer able to work so i don t have those human connections anymore my wife had been my best friend so when she surprised me by suddenly leaving the last person i had a connection with went with her now that my congestive heart failure has progressed just walking enough to shop for groceries take out the trash or getting the mail is a huge challenge so just going out to walk around and meet people is near impossible having zero available disposable income also doesn t help if i can hold on a couple more months and everything works out i ll be able to switch schools and have more aid

My best friend died this morning,my best friend of 11 years died in a car crash that happened last night he was riding with one of his other friends and he was high while he was driving my friend was in the back of the truck when it happened this wasn t a collision with another car he hit a guard rail and my friend went flying out of the back of the car he died on impact but the paramedics were able to resuscitate him the guy driving ran away in the woods nearby my friend died 3 times before they finally pulled the plug i hate to imagine the pain he was in everyone around me keeps mentioning him and i can t handle it we grew up together and now he s gone i went to a pawnshop nearby my school while i was waiting for my brother and i met the dad of one of my friends who was also really close to my friend who died we talked for about 90 minutes before i left the only good part about today is that i know i m not the only person who cared about him,557,61,441.8979328

I recently read this and I think it might help someone else too: ‚ÄúAlways do your best‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúwork until you collapse‚Äù. If you push yourself past your best abilities you will do worse. Doing your best means knowing your limits and working within them.,it s not the literal thing i read but something along those lines and i actually had an oh moment that i have extremely rarely i never realized that i misheard doing my best as i should push myself to be the best but how good you are at something is on a bell curve and if you strive past your best you will become worse it actually kinda helps a little with not feeling guilty about taking breaks but anyway i thought someone else might need to hear this too,561,47,1787.077493
No one ever talks about how tiring it is to have mental illness.,suffering from mental illness is one of the most draining things everyone knows about the overt effects of anxiety depression etc but the damage this can have on your energy levels seems to get overlooked when your brain is attacking itself 24 7 it never has a chance to rest this doesn t even just manifest itself in being mentally tired but being physically tired my muscles ache i move slowly and am constantly fighting the urge to just lie down due to covid i ve been forced to move back into with my parents now things are opening up again they ve had some of their friends over for dinner and find myself being outlasted by them constantly a bunch of people in their mid 60s have more energy than a 23 year old it s embarrassing and pathetic i just hate that having to deal with mental illness every waking minute wasn t enough but now i ve also got to have the stamina levels of someone in their 80s it s not fair,555,45,1419.389414
I don't want quarantine to end,after a long time of chaos this is the first time in many years i ve been able to create a daily and healthy routine without getting overwhelmed by it and destroying it due to anxiety and changes i have school phobia and i don t want zoom classes to end i feel so comfortable studying on a screen and not having to trigger my school and social phobia obviously there are things social distancing made it worse for me like intrusive thoughts and lack of therapy but i m now getting used to it and i fear when all of this ends i m going to go to my unhealthy lifestyle again because of stress,559,61,1759.23085

Stop telling those with mental health problems what they're doing wrong without telling them what the right action is.,one of the things i regularly see people doing when trying to help those with mental health problems is to call out how they re thinkin negatively or irrationally or whatever they re doing wrong this is only half of the step as someone who suffers from mental health problems this doesn t help it just feels like a dig when you point this out i already know i know i m being irrational i know i m being negative but i don t know how to be rational or positive i need help i need you to tell me what the rational or positive thought is i need to be made aware of the exact actions i could take or thoughts i could have to help me stop feeling this way and i guarantee other people do to when we re criticised on the way we re thinking and not given any advice it can be a trigger when we re criticised on the way we re thinking but given advice to overcome this it is actually helpful,554,125,1489.290456

I ate in a restaurant by myself!,yesterday i had a doctor s appointment in the morning and a psychiatrist appointment about an hour and a half later i didn t really want to drive home between the appointments so i decided to get lunch normally my anxiety would be too bad and i would just get something to go and eat in my car parked in a corner somewhere but instead i ordered a sandwich and salad and sat down and ate in the restaurant i was fairly calm and concentrated on my food and my phone to not be too self aware i realized there were other people sitting alone and that helped me feel less uncomfortable it s just a small silly thing but i am so proud of myself,550,42,2211.237979

Stop blaming your shit parenting on my phone.,it s that phone okay so you re gonna sit there telling me that my depression and crap cognition is because of my phone and not because of the emotional neglect and trauma you gave me and not the fact that you won t take me to a professional so i can possibly get a diagnosis which could help with those grades you always yell at for like i ve been asking you to alright,548,66,1645.324981
I'm so happy I didn't commit suicide last May.,i was at such a low point i voluntarily checked myself into a psych ward last may because i found myself idealizing suicide drawing up plans to end it and getting my finances in order i gave most of my things away said my goodbyes even wrote a letter i m currently sitting behind my desk at work my boss isn t in and i have my own office so i m completely alone with no one to bother me i get paid well for my position along with being a student i ve become an emt i m finishing up my dual degree in computer science and mathematics my relationships with the people who matter most to me are at an all time high i have self worth confidence i m making healthier physical health and mental health choices i m achieving all of my dreams and aspirations and i m happy i m genuinely happy i compared how i am doing this summer to last summer and the improvement is magnificent i now enjoy life and see that there is so much to live for it s tough at times sometimes it gets really lonely dark empty lifeless but that s not true your life is full of life because you re alive you have so much potential you just need to tap into it i did it and i m finally in a better place after 5 years of a shit storm you can too i promise hang in there friend no matter how long the fight takes stay in that ring it ll be all so much worth it when you get through to the other side sends cyber hugs,542,38,2057.250248

He took a snack from me!!,this is absolutely fantastic and a wonderful sign i m so excited and happy he s getting better my son has been hospitalized for schizophrenia and he wouldn t eat normally because he believes someone is trying to poison him we are slowly making progress he s taking his pills willingly he ll let me sit near him and interact with me a little bit and today he took a small snack from me when i offered it this is so big he s had a feeding tube for a while and now he s actually eating and he s eating from me i gave him something and he ate it it was just one of those little packages of goldfish crackers i think it helped that it was dry and prepackaged im just so happy he s eating im about to cry i m just so glad he s finally eating,531,46,1373.230109
Stop telling boys that they shouldn't cry.,when i was around 10 years old i watched my teenage brother nurse a wound he was crying as he soaked his scraped knee with water in the bathtub i looked at him with disdain why are you crying i asked in annoyance i didn t realize it then but my visceral reaction to his emotional vulnerability reflected something that i had been taught earlier in my childhood boys aren t supposed to cry when i became a young adult i had a lot of trouble expressing my emotions i put on a smile for everyone i saw and avoided talking about anything that would trigger an emotional reaction when my emotions built up to the point where i couldn t control them i would explode it took a long time to learn how to share my feelings something that people still consider to be a sign of weakness in men i think i m one of the millions of men out there who ve been told at some point in their lives to repress their emotions i now understand how emotional repression can lead to a variety of complications in mental health i wrote a song to challenge the idea that men shouldn t show their feelings simply because they are men listen link below for all the guys out there listening to this song be vulnerable feel your emotions share with others how you feel i think that s even more manly than being a tough guy thank you guys so much for reading this please be safe everyone xoxo listen here,533,46,1733.057007
"I brushed, flossed, used mouthwash, got lunch with my mom AND played video games!",usually i just spend the day getting smelly and sleeping but i ve actually been regularly taking care of my teeth i did need to take a long nap today but i was able to do two things i rarely have the motivation to do i m proud of myself and mom and i ate at our favorite restaurant,538,32,2231.908407
I woke up so fucking happy,i woke up so fucking happy and motivated to be productive and get out of my slump i woke up at 6 00am i made my bed showered did laundry made breakfast hell i even participated in my meeting when i got to work but the more day went on i felt my energy and positive thought just fade now i m sitting here in my room with my lights off thinking of how much a waste of space i am i so fucking tired man i just want to be happy i want to stop waking up at noon every day and dread my day,534,49,1491.883778
I finally took a shower and brushed my teeth !,i hadn t showered in a week i didn t brush my teeth either during this time but i did use mouthwash most of the days i was finally able to push myself to do it for a job interview now if i get this job i just have to push myself through work every day,530,45,2149.757088
Two weeks ago I was almost homeless. Now I got a job and a place to stay and my mental health seems to be improving a lot,i think is important to share some positive news as well since sometimes we just come here in our lowest times and i shared here previously when i thought i was at one of the direst moments of my life it has been two weeks i was basically out of money in a new city have searched everywhere for a job but couldn t find any so i decided to go to the social services center at the town hall to see if they could help me anyway shared with the staff my story and how i was going to be homeless that same day but since it is a small city the social worker contacted a friend of hers that owned a place that was looking for a woman to cook clean and receive guests at a private tourist attraction although i m male she decided to give me a chance and so it has been two weeks of hard work but everything is working out so far i actually like the job a lot and my employer seems to be quite happy with my performance and already increased my salary from past week my anxiety and depression are way under control now it seems that since my work requires more doing and less thinking it just keeps my mind better focused in the job and been glad for this opportunity that while i still get some intrusive thoughts once in a while they are way less aggressive than they were in the past few months years so that is it just sharing a story with a better ending than i expected so that maybe it give those of you guys who are still facing harder times a glimmer of hope that things may get better for you too is a bit cheesy but in the end hope is sometimes all that we have left and guts to keep on fighting wherever way you can,530,22,1416.933014
I took a shower for the first time in a month or so.,please don t judge been having a hard time but this is a major win for me,530,86,1107.542157
Sending out hugs for anyone who needs one,and maybe because i need one too,534,65,1590.265421
We should make mental health checkups a thing,like seeing a psychologist for a checkup should be normalized like seeing a doctor for a physical should be routine to see one every year why wait for a crisis to see one,530,59,1015.19688
I finally brushed my teeth!!,just a small victory from today i cannot put into words how happy i am that i finally got off my ass and picked up a toothbrush for once i ve gone weeks not brushing only doing so on special occasions which still doesn t do anything in improving their state but now i want to continue taking care of them since i have been kind of neglecting my own body lately the water is still painfully cold when combined with toothpaste but i ll learn to deal with it since it benefits me,527,80,1168.256671
"Just because it is (sadly) normal for ppl to experience suicidal thoughts especially at the moment, suicidal thoughts themselves are not normal PLZ STOP NORMALIZING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS",sorry for the caps lock but it really concerns me i m not saying this without any context its something ive heard ppl say before well everyone has dark thoughts and most ppl are just able to deal with them sorry if it sounds a bit melodramatic but would you say to someone with cancer symptoms well lots of people experience symptoms that might be caused by cancer and they just dealt with them by themselves no u wouldn t so plz dont do it for mental health either,524,40,1475.497748

"Revived a Baby, Feel Really Raw",two days ago my neighbor whom i don t know came screaming for help out of her house i happened to be walking my dog after a split second of worrying i may be stepping into a domestic violence and thus dangerous situation i knew i needed to help either way so i ran up and said i could help that s when i realized she was holding a non responsive not breathing baby time slowed down i stashed my dog inside her front door took the baby and narrated each step of heimlich sweeping the mouth etc i was eerily calm and the baby started crying i had to do it a second time when she stopped breathing again meanwhile the woman who was her grandmother was on the phone with 911 and understandably in such a panic the police came first because neighbors called about the screaming then the ambulance a bit after that and a good 5 10 minutes after i got there i feel so so lucky i happened to be there and somehow remembered lifeguard training from 15 years ago and i feel humbled in like a pre social media definition of it and i feel weird that all the other neighbors were watching but no one came to help and most of all i just feel raw like i feel really weird about it all and like i m exposed extra weird thing is i saved someone kayaking 10 days prior i have never saved anyone s life before and two have two in 10 days as a regular person non first responder and especially the baby two days ago i am just shaken up,524,59,965.8647384
I planned to kill myself today but I didn‚Äôt.,edit i am overwhelmed by the support i have been provided today after coming home from work all i did was lay down today and dick around on the internet and for this to be part of my general tomfoolery i use to distract myself i am grateful i don t really know how to reply to everyone i ve largely snapped out of it but i am still frazzled and having a lot of trouble getting back to sleep it s 3am as i type this i don t have weapons or drugs that could easily kill me i am not alone so i will be okay i ll try to focus on spending time with myself tomorrow and do something to make myself feel better thank you again for the support i woke up this morning with an unshakable feeling that today would be the day i finally commit suicide i figured i could throw myself in front of a train i said goodbye to my boyfriend and told him i love him i ended up not doing that because i had professional obligations and made promises by the time it was over my colleague offered to drive me home so i wouldn t take the train so i got home safe and was able to snap out of it it feels like a bad dream and now i just want to lay down and go to sleep i ve been feeling horribly inferior to everyone around me i m not intelligent i don t have any special skills and i really believe nothing will be lost if i died i feel as if i should just accept my inherent worthlessness and just save everyone the trouble of me breathing their air i don t want to reach out to people who know me because i don t want to worry them and i certainly don t want them thinking i m just looking for attention or validation my therapist is also not being super helpful i am not sure i ve made much progress what should i do if it happens again i don t want to burden everyone else,531,77,1267.374426
Does anyone else just feel like crying whenever you hear stories of people getting mental health support from their parents because you just know you won‚Äôt ever have the same?,idk if i m being too specific or if it even makes sense every time i hear stories of people voicing their struggles to their parents and them understanding supporting and even getting them help i just feel like crying it makes me happy for them but also extremely sad for me because i know i cannot tell my parents about my issues because i ll just be ignored or they ll minimize my problems by comparing them to their own i ve been thinking about this for days i guess i just want to know i m not the only one who feels this way,525,53,1451.219299

I hate when people say suicide is selfish,they say people who commit suicide are selfish for not caring about everyone around them being sad when you commit suicide usually you believe with all your heart that everyone in the world would be better off without you or that they don t care it is the most unselfish thing i can think of not saying its a good idea but being able to give up your own life just to make everyone a little happier even if it doesn t actually but just in the person s head is not selfish it s horrible tragic but not selfish x200b edit i m not suicidal by the way and dudes stop insinuating suicide is okay when you have a mental illness suicide is never ok but we need to not guilt people into not committing suicide,522,162,2234.28563

Calling Suicide Selfish,i saw someone on my friends list post about someone they knew who committed suicide being selfish and i am not in the mood to play around about this let me fucking tell you something i am so sick and tired of hearing people say that suicide is selfish you want to know what s fucking selfish expecting someone else to live for you expecting someone to put their own personal pain to the side for your fucking happiness expecting your relationship or companionship to be that saving grace to pull anyone through a deep depression that is the epitomy of selfish it is no one s responsibility to do anything that makes other people happy or comfortable you are not owed any of that you don t get to tell someone who s suicidal that they re selfish for considering it and that they should think about others egos before their suffering you don t get to call someone selfish after they commit suicide because they didn t think about everyone else s feelings when they obviously couldn t even handle their own on top of the fact that it s disrespectful to speak ill of the dead how selfish do you have to be to have the audacity to call someone selfish when you are the one who wants a dangerously depressed person to continue suffering just so you can continue to ignore all the symptoms but hand them a god damn gold start sticker for being alive like it fucking helps anything and before you even bring religion into the conversation news flash not everyone believes in your god so telling someone god doesn t make mistakes suicide is a sin god only gives us what we can handle or some other idiotic bullshit doesn t bring everyone comfort and sometimes it makes things worse and that s not your opportunity to tell them all the ways they need to find god because again not everyone believes in your fucking god end of telling a suicidal person that wanting to end their pain is selfish will only tell them that they cannot confide in you and it marks you as an unreliable support system it will more than likely make them pull away from you and make them feel even more isolated you re not helping and don t use the excuses i ve been through worse and i don t want to kill myself or other people have it worse because you obviously don t understand what mental illness is being depressed about a situation is so much different than being clinically depressed situational depression lasts through a particular struggle clinical depression is being sad for almost no god damn reason don t compare the two because you re only making yourself look like more of an asshole it is selfish of you to want someone to continue suffering just to make you happy get off your fucking high horse,508,154,1097.967275
Mental health problems are not beautiful or trendy and I am so done with the media glamorizing it.,can the media stop glamorizing this notion that battling mental illness is beautiful or trendy i m all for expressing emotions in a healthy manner and using music as an emotional outlet and certainly want to hear music that is honest but not at the cost of minimizing the pain and struggles that people all over the world face on a daily basis being broken is not beautiful being broken is sobbing uncontrollably when you have a delay getting your meds refilled while your boyfriend strokes your hair trying to convince you that things will get better addiction is not the modern day version of romeo and juliet addiction is an stable irreversible at best or a death sentence at worst staying in an abusive relationship is not being loyal to your man woman and you re not better than anyone else for fighting through the bullshit you re suffering from stockholm syndrome and i hope to god you get out soon being sad is not cute and i don t want to wear it on a hat edit if you re in a position of influence big or small use that influence to encourage others to seek help and get better not falsely celebrate being somewhere no wants to be,513,63,2127.36841
I hate how most suicide prevention messages focus on family,the message always is that family cares killing yourself will make family sad it entirely ignores the fact that some families are the very cause of suicide how some families abuse their kids or how some parents have their kids solely for selfish reasons,510,33,1060.503109
It‚Äôs been 10 years since my suicide attempt and I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt succeed!!,somehow i missed my 10 year anniversary of the worst day of my life i suppose that s a good thing that i m so involved with the good bits of life now that i almost forgot that this wasn t always the case ten years ago i threw my legs out a 6th floor window at college intending to hit the earth below me i was in the thick of some really terrible times then i was 19 heartbroken homesick lost and very confused i remember the sharp air that rushed in the room when i opened the window that very cold and snowy february night it felt like little needles on my skin a stark contrast to the hot salty tears streaming down my face i was in trouble for drinking on campus again however the drinking wasn t just purely fun and games i was using it to cope with a lot of uncertainty and hopelessness my on again off again boyfriend told me he was dating someone else he lived with my best guy friend at the time so a lot of sides were taken in the whole mess and somewhere along the way my roommate moved out i was alone i spent the remainder of the week at the hospital under psychiatric care the days i spent there blur together now i was in such a haze of numbness my entire life was uprooted i got kicked out of college and i had to start over somewhere new the next several years were spent kicking my ass into gear to show myself and the friends who abandoned me that they didn t get the best of me i pushed and pushed myself i started looking forward and not backward i learned to love myself again slowly very slowly i graduated from a new and better college with honors two years later i took a chance and bought a one way ticket to nyc and began living the life i used to only be able to dream about 10 years later i am living proof that things get better depression and anxiety are challenges i still deal with occasionally but now i know how to handle it right now i m sitting in the house i just bought all by myself i m reminiscing about the years i spent living and working in manhattan where i had an incredible job and amazing friends most days my life felt like a happy movie i recently decided to re locate slow things down and enjoy the present now i m in the process of renovating my house from the inside out i volunteer with an organization that raises funds for underprivileged women and children i carve out time for my hobbies friends and loved ones i ve truly become a better person i can now enjoy a glass or two of wine without overdoing it just to cope i can take a deep breath a small sip and appreciate how far i ve come i still have a long way to go i m still a work in progress i haven t found love yet but i look forward to the day i do in the meantime you can catch me cultivating my new herb garden and reading a good book or two if you re going through what i went through 10 years ago my best advice is to hang on know it does get better and no this isn t something that people just say it s true you re not alone you re loved and you re stronger than you think take a deep breath be thankful that you are able to do so and repeat until you truly believe better days are around the corner tldr i m 10 years post suicide attempt and better than ever i wanted to share my accomplishment with you all and hope this story might help someone,511,31,1787.913063

"How I became a happier and kinder person, and accidently started liking myself a lot more",i did a random experiment on myself a few years ago i did not read about this anywhere i just thought of it and decided to try it i forced myself to think nice thoughts about every stranger i see when i see someone on the street i think of something nice about that person like their hair look so good what a nice smile those legs are great etc in the beginning it was hard like the first thought that popped up was something mean but then i followed it up to find something good about the person if i don t find anything nice to think about their appearances it happens i don t force it instead i make a nice assumption about them i think she probably has a great sense of humour he is probably a great dad this person could be very creative etc just whatever pops up and the great part is it doesn t matter if it s true or not i just form a nice assumption in my mind in the beginning i had to consciously make the decision to think something nice after a while it started automatically happen it s been years but now every time i go out i think mostly kind thoughts about people this lead me to think more nice thoughts about myself when i see myself in a mirror i m no longer trained to search for flaws i automatically think nice things about myself aswell i m a much more confident person due to this if you want to try this i recommend starting with strangers when that becomes natural apply it to everyone your classmates your colleagues your friends force yourself to focus on the positives if you think something negative of someone thats perfectly okay but follow it up with something nice now i have an easier time giving people spontaneous and genuine compliments because that s how my mind works i m a lot happier and calmer around people when i think kind thoughts about everyone and this is not something that happened naturally i had to train myself to do this and it worked i want to add that i ve had some friends that were the opposite the kind that thinks it s fun to roast everyone they see and say mean things about strangers or acquaintances i talked to them about this talked to them about how i m changing my mindset and asked them to not behave like this around me some changed some i am no longer friends with not a big loss in hindsight people that act like that was a negative influence in my life anyway if you try this good luck and please let me know how it goes for you it will probably feel super weird and silly in the beginning but try to stick with it for a while and see what happens to your thought patterns,501,39,1187.369579
"Has anyone else lost ""friends"" that made it seem like your mental illness was a bigger inconvenience for them than it was for you?",i use the word friends loosely because they no longer hold that title i went through a pretty rough phase of about six months my depression and anxiety were at an all time high i won t go into all the details but i just needed someone to be there for me i was told by two friends of 10 years that my depression was too much and that they couldn t handle it they told me that i needed to own up to my actions being depressed i guess then they just deleted me from everything and stopped talking to me some friends eh still makes me sick to this day but perhaps it s better to be rid of those people don t get me wrong i know it can be difficult when your friends don t have their shit together but isn t that what friends are for to support you and be there for you when you re in a dark place i can t even imagine doing what they did but maybe that s just me i guess i m just wondering if anyone has experienced this as well please feel free to share your stories would be nice to know i m not completely alone,499,63,1518.710759

"Does anyone else just have that feeling that they want to go home, when they‚Äôre already home?",i don t know how to explain it all that well like the feeling you had as a child when you were at the grocery store and wanted to go home it s that same feeling but slightly less intense and now as an adult when sitting at home,495,66,1463.648688
Recovering from depression really feels like I‚Äôm trying to stay ‚Äúsober‚Äù,first i ve never had to deal with substance abuse and if what i saying is insensitive please let me know it really does feel like what i imagine abstaining from alcohol or drugs feels like but instead of that your abstaining from bad choices for example can t stay out with friends because if i don t have a regular sleep routine it will drastically effect my mood can t drink a lot of caffeine because it will effect my sleep schedule and my mood can t drink alcohol because with messes with my medication and my mood can t think those negative thoughts or otherwise i will spiral can t stay in bed all morning or otherwise you ll stay in bed all day or even several days i have to perform basic hygiene even though it is really hard today or else you ll feel ten times worse was wondering if anyone else felt like this edit oh wow i did not expect this to get any comments or votes i have suffered depression for over a decade staring in my teen years i did not get the help that i needed until recently and therefore developed many bad habits to try and cope with it but for the past few months i ve been working on getting better but then i spiraled really bad during the holidays because i strayed from my rigid routine so now i m trying to start all over again but it really helps to know that other people feel this way too thanks for the awards and comments,496,22,1510.787403
"If you are suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts, this the wisdom I‚Äôve gathered since my suicide attempt a decade ago.",first and foremost you need some rest i would say that 10 10 times when i have suicidal ideation it s also when i am over tired or over worked secondly there are people in your life that genuinely care enough to force you into help i know it s scary to reach out to them and admit that you are having a hard time alone but i whole heartedly recommend it i would not be alive to type this if it weren t for the wonderful people in my support network one method my friend and i came up with is that i can kill myself i just have to get his permission first this gives me the benefit of having the option but also puts the social pressure on me to never do it i know you might think no one gives a shit but the same people who would be devastated if you died would probably prefer to help you out before it gets to that point there is something socially validating about suicide in the brain of the suicidal it feels easier than to admit you are having a hard time you feel like people will take what you are going through seriously but plain and simple you will not be around to enjoy that validation because you will be dead and all the people who would have helped you will be asking what they could have done instead of leaving the people you love on this earth with the trauma of dealing with your death please reach out to them lastly what you have gone through is not easy you may feel exhausted defeated or even angry at others self reflection might be productive but you are right to feel angry at how they treated you what you do with that anger is your responsibility now and it seems like you are just letting it eat away at you maybe there is some way to can transfer that anger into productivity or artistic expression who knows you have real problems they suck you re totally right to feel that way you should feel no blame that shitty things happen to you but these problems are still your responsibility and there are people out there who can help again i would not be alive today if it wasn t for the friend i mentioned above and a wonderful therapist who came in at the right time you may not have luck the first few times my first therapist sent me into a mental breakdown but i promise you that you will find the right fit if you keep trying focus on the problems that you can solve i think about the serenity prayer they say in aa every day grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference there are many issues in your life you may not have control over but there are some that you do focus on those try to define them as precisely as possible don t say everybody hates me say everybody hates me when i ______ the first is a cry of defeat the second gives you a concrete area of yourself that you can improve i always tell my friend if you are going to hate yourself at least be more specific there is so much in life worth living for a beautiful sunrise your daughter s graduation some day hell even if it s just a new season of a tv show you love the future is a mystery and that s a good thing it means that everything is going to change if things are good they are going to get worse but that also means if things are bad they are going to get better take solace in that during the bad times and prepare yourself what things feel like they are going too well don t hesitate to dm me if there is anything i can help you with we re all on this crazy ride together god bless also posted on r male mental health edit thank you to everyone who shared their stories or sent their kind words i hope that this post does not glamorize suicide attempts in any way yes i tried but that doesn t delegitimize the suffering of someone who hasn t just because you haven t attempted doesn t make your situation any less valid or serious compared to anyone else s remember my words above a suicidal persons warped sense of reality tells them that suicide is a better option than reaching out for help it is not ever many of you have reached out to me in a pm and i thank you for reaching out to someone i am always a friend in need to someone but i am not a professional there are real professionals out there making a difference just waiting to be the change you need in your life remember the best thing you can do is reach out if you are considering suicide please call the suicide hotline i cannot stress this service enough it has saved the lives of people close to me 800 273 8255,494,81,2180.375331

Did your parent ever say ‚Äústop crying before i give you something to cry about‚Äù?,edit i should say children under 6 or 7 so many parents mine included said this to me as a child i think it s so harmful to children because they are tiny humans with emotions that they don t understand how to control and my personal opinion is that it is a parent s responsibility to teach their child how to navigate negative emotions does anyone feel this way as well lets talk about it,498,193,1449.213456
"I like to think, whenever you ""pour one out"" for a friend or family member who has passed, in whatever afterlife you picture them in, a cup appears in front of them and they get to drink whatever you poured out for them.",i ll start by saying i m agnostic and i dont really believe in absolutes because no one can see the future no one really knows whats happening in someone else s head and you can t predict who will pull through whatever or who will be lost to whatever and there s no way to really know what happens when we die in all honesty that thought brings me comfort i dont think im a bad person sure ive done shitty things im human like you i assume but this mindset is what has gotten me through some rough shit 2019 is my worst year to date august 24 a good friend who i really looked up to committed suicide i credit him to be a big part in preventing my own suicide then in november a great uncle and a high school classmate both i was very fond of passed within a couple days of each other then december 10 my grandma passed after a stroke the week prior her husband my grandpa passed in may 2020 that was a bad time as you can imagine i had never lost anyone i was ever close to before then my friends suicide being the big thing im still struggling with today but whenever i have a beer or some liquor i pour one out in his their name i like to imagine my friend in valhalla as of all the afterlives that i know of thats where he belongs as he is a fucking legend he lost his battle with depression but he fought fucking hard i still laugh and smile at the thought of him in any afterlife yelling at whoever is in charge because they don t understand the rules of whatever afterlife pathfinder game he s running and i like to think that wherever he my grandparents my old high school buddy and my great uncle may be when i pour one out a beautiful mug full of that liquid is presented to them which that thought is made better by the fact that often times im drinking really shitty cheap booze and they look up from wherever they are and are just kinda what the fuck you pour one out in mourning and im stuck with your shitty 1 dollar beer i dont know just a thought that may help someone in mourning hang in there stranger no matter how shitty life gets it will always get better and despite the fact that life will get shitty again at some point it will get better again hang in there,498,36,1514.734012
New job! Still homeless but I got a new job! Mental health is on the uptick!,i am so fucking excited story time before covid hit i was a leasing agent for a large canadian reit i was important i was valued i was paid very well i had everything i wanted i was fortunate enough to be sent to calgary to launch one of the largest private student housing projects in canadian history was a big big deal in the industry then covid came along and decimated the student housing industry 50 of our clients were international and of the remaining 50 being domestic only a small fraction of those were locally domestic you can imagine what losing 90 of your paying clients can do for a project i lost my job and came home defeated my mental health suffered my physical health suffered my relationship suffered i wasn t working i wasn t a partner anymore my girl left me in dec things were hard i was alone i m very much an introvert the only people i talk to are people via reddit or random women on dating apps there s nobody i could call to come over and hang out with nobody i could call if i was having a dark moment and there were many dark moments let me tell you winter blues is a thing i m a huge believer in that i was living in a basement apartment that my ex and i shared before she left i was so immobile emotionally and physically that for 5 months after she left i couldn t bring myself to removing anything she left behind she took the cats but the cat food sat in its dish for months her clothes still hung in the closet the way she left them every day was a dark dank lonely sad existence i knew i needed a change i had to change my outlook my direction my goals i started talking to people on dating apps i had no intention of seeing anyone i just needed to talk to people again that helped i also started being more active on reddit that helped too i like talking with people i like giving advice small uptick in mental health after this then the sun started coming out the grey dirty snow started going away it was the end of april forced myself to go outside even for a minute even for that very short walk to get milk instead of ordering it i went and got it small uptick in mental health after this i got closure with my ex finally small uptick here i needed something drastic though so voluntary homelessness i left my apartment i rented a room and when that went to shit i started living out of my car waking up in the bush next to a river down by the ocean did wonders not caring or worrying about anything nothing at all just being entirely selfish in my needs my mental health huge uptick i started smiling again i started feeling better about everything x200b was going to spend the entire summer living outta my car then one random night i applied for a building manager job its become so much more than that i was just given a job offer for a leasing agent role and a building manager role for a smaller reit but this position will require me to be very mobile i could be driving 3hrs away to one of our buildings i will never sit in an office the company car is my office its going to be a couple weeks before i can afford an apartment or i might just continue to live out of my car which may be tough because i ll also have a company car so we ll see what happens there but huge huge uptick motivation is high excitement is high self worth is high i m valued again they were hugely impressed with my skill set and its feels so damn good to be valued again i wanted to share this because i ve said to 100s of people on this very same sub that things can change but you need to be the catalyst for that change nobody is going to come along and place change at your feet you are responsible for everything that happens in your life regardless of what has happened in your life wake up tomorrow forge forward make a small change in your life and allow it to snowball things are on an uptick now but things dont get any easier with this uptick comes a tremendous amount of responsibility people are invested in me this motivates me i ll wake up tomorrow for my first day with a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm but will have to know and understand that a downtick can come at anytime i ll deal with those when they come i m not going to worry about something that hasn t happened yet forward progress be the catalyst for change and personal growth have your pity party be sad have regret but you gotta get over it you gotta find closure and move on because the world will continue to spin without you may aswell spin with it amirite,499,18,1358.620806
I dont want to kill myself but I don't want to be alive either. It feels like I'm being forced to suffer and the only things that make me happy are just distractions from getting better.,i fucking hate myself and everyone around me i hate my mother my dad and my brother i hate my best friend i hate my fucked up body and being alive is just morbid and disgusting my mum is refusing to take proper care of my pets which i now have 5 of because she wanted more and will probably try to get more i do the best i can but she still fucking overfeeds them so my two new kittens are going to be overweight and sick like the rest of my animals if i show any sign of disagreement which is basically fucking impossible because she will literally say look how fat theyre getting isnt it cute and i cant help but look miserable or telling her that what shes doing is wrong she will threaten to kick me out to move in with my dad which she has done multiple times before i cant stay there because the whole house is covered in mould and i have breathing issues because ive been smoking cigarettes weed heroin pills suboxone and tons of other crap since i was 12 years old my breathing is so fucked i am constantly aware of my lungs and just breathing fresh air makes me feel so disgusted to be alive i have an infection in my mouth and another in my sinus which i basically have permanently because of the fucked up structure of my face im not taking drugs anymore but i still smoke a cigarette every few days and i am so guilty because no matter how hard i seem to try i cant even take care of myself i live in fucking sydney where the house and rent prices are so fucked even if could find a trade or work i wouldnt be able to move out the only person i had that understood and was there with me through all this shit was raped and murdered almost two years he was my best fucking friend the only person my age that i had been friends with in 6 years my other best and only friend is addicted to fucking heroin and has aspergers so he just jumps to conclusions and gets mad at me if i show him any sort of emotion about things that are going on in my life he just thinks im weak i stopped seeing him because hes a horrible fucking influence but i end up visiting him every week because i want social contact but i just end up regretting it and leaving his house after an hour ive recently been diagnosed with fucking epilepsy so thats fun i have seizures when i dont get enough sleep and i cant because my mum is fucking yelling or if im at my dads house he is up all night singing and working literally all night he sleeps from 6 am to 4 pm so im constantly worried about having a siezure and i try so hard to get good sleep so recently my sleeps been good enough that i dont think im at seizure risk but still bad enough that my health is on a strong and steady decline my brother doesnt talk to me hes becoming an alcoholic i mean hes been drinking everyday for the past year but atleast hes stopped stealing off me and doesnt threaten to beat me up everytime i make eye contact with him anymore i really dont want to kill myself but i have felt so bad my whole life and i cant seem to turn it around that i think if it keeps going it will be the only reasonable option this is fucking bullshit why the fuck are the people around my happy they are all fucking kidding themselves and need to just accept the fact there lives fucking suck so maybe they might actually do something to help themselves and inturn the people that care about them i hate everyone i care about and it makes me so fucking angry i cant ever express this anger to everyone i love thats hurting me because they just seem to treat me worse,490,34,1492.502044

"I hate how people are expected to wait weeks, possibly MONTHS for mental health appointments.",last month i had an appointment that i had to book out two months in advance from then on my next appointment is a month and a half away out of all the things to make people wait for this is probably one of if not the worst does the government or anyone with any position of power understand the consequences of making people who are trying to get their mental health examined wait long periods of time more funding needs to be put into this also i wish society was less toxic and edgy towards each other but i digress i myself am doing okay but i can t imagine the pain others go through when they re told that they have to wait several weeks or even months to get their next appointment and how agonizing it can be it s like you re about to reach the finish line at a race and you slowly shrink in size it taking progressively more and more time energy and probably psychological madness to reach the finish line just felt a need to rant is all,494,117,1913.735331

I got connected to the same suicide hotline operator twice,i was in a crisis a few months ago and needed to vent so i called suicide hotline this isn t something i do too often but i have called a handful of times i don t even remember why i was so upset but i know it was right before i dropped out of school and cut ties with a best friend who treated me terribly and i was just venting to him about how i didn t know what to do with myself or whatever after explaining my situation for a couple minutes he asks my name again and then he says we have spoken before he had remembered that i liked going for drives to clear my mind and remembered how i had told him about my friends that had been sent to jail and he asked how they were doing i can t deny that it brightened my day i appreciated him so much he told me about how his daughter also struggled with school and he understood what it was like what are the odds of being matched with the same worker a year later,494,17,1929.902403

Does anyone else have difficulty holding down jobs because of your illness?,i feel like i always meet other adults who are able to work despite their illness and go to work everyday and be fine but i never meet anyone else who just can t seem hold down jobs no matter how hard they try i do really well for a month or two i get praised for my work i get friendly with co workers i start to get into the groove of what i have to do i don t know what happens i just spiral after that my brain just gets tired of having to hold it in and act like everything is fine the strain of having to override my feelings and force my brain to function starts to exhaust me and i can t conceal it for as long going into work starts to get harder and i have to find ways to take a break and cry i call off too much because i can t handle it anymore i have panic attacks at the thought of going in and end up quitting the only job i was able to keep was a rare place where my co workers also had their own illnesses i could be open if i was having a hard time and they would be understanding and vice versa but unfortunately that s not a commonality i just feel disappointed in myself i m 25 and i want to do better i feel like i should be doing better but no matter how many times i try i just can t it won t stop me from trying again but it s extremely discouraging,488,94,1484.307322
I called a suicide hotline recently and was dismissed because I‚Äôm a man and I have Tourette‚Äôs. üí¶ü¶Ñüòñ,i looked the up on google cause i was feeling unstable with signs of psychosis i know these symptoms well enough after years of dealing with my illness i forced myself to remain calm so i could clearly communicate my situation the woman her name was rachel speaking with was clearly overwhelmed by how many calls they ve been getting when i told her i was having a mental health crisis she took me seriously enough but then my verbal tics started i could tell that my tics were scaring her so i told her i m safe i just have tourettes then i heard the dreaded word come out of my mouth cunt it was clearly a tic but rachel s reaction was to tell me i couldn t talk to her that way her tone went from scared shitless to anger that was when i knew that there is not going to be any help for me at least not from a woman i realized then that i wasn t going to be able to get reliable help and to just get off the phone to be honest it kinda ramped up my paranoia also before i got off the phone i calmed myself and quietly told her you are a mental health professional who has trained for this when a person experiencing a mental health crisis calls you and uses a word you find offensive you need to remember that you re feelings at that moment are minuscule compared to the pain the person on the other end is going through please think about this because you re hurting some people more than you re helping them i am so angry about this i did everything right i know from experience how broken our mental health system is but this really hits a new low i took extensive notes because it seemed important and am really tempted to get that woman fired from her job for being so unprofessional but frankly i m worried i ll get a woman on the line in hr and will again be dismissed because of sexism from now on i will ask for and only speak with men when calling the suicide hotline s one thing i know for sure i am not calling 911 for a trip to the psych ward anytime soon if the mental health system is in this much crisis just over the phone imagine how bad it s falling apart face to face thank god i m already so used to self isolating edit thank you to everyone who reached out i appreciate it just so this doesn t head into finger pointing territory i want to clarify a few things it s easy to take from this that i m taking my anger out on women that s fair and tbh i ll acknowledge a lack of trust on my part if you wrote something supportive and or helpful thank you for hearing me if you wrote something that showed a lack of empathy that s ok you just didn t hear me i m used to that,487,107,1801.330007

I got an apology from my old psychiatrist,when i was 13 around the early 2000s my parents got worried as i was making the transition from elementary school to middle school they had me see a psychiatrist who did no testing or talking with me before writing me a prescription for some ssris the dosage was very high and my parents weren t told to taper me on or off i had intense sleepiness trouble caring about things trouble remembering my friends names i slept so deeply that i didn t even wake up to my body s signals to use the bathroom i was a teenaged boy pissing his own bed my grades plummeted and that made my parents simply insist on higher doses the psychiatrist i was seeing wrote those prescriptions too still never looked me in the eye i knew something was wrong but it was months before i could focus enough to tell my parents luckily they listened and i never had to take those pills again but for the next 18 years i went through life blaming myself for not adjusting to a new school quickly enough or well enough when i was old enough to make my own appointments i spent hours and hours and hundreds of dollars getting evaluated for every possible mental illness i even had blood tests all the tests came back saying i was normal and healthy but it still tugged at me a few weeks ago i found the courage to find that psychiatrist and then i wrote him a letter asking for an apology i was respectful stating the facts of the matter first and then moving on to how it made me feel in the years afterward i was clear that i only wanted an apology but didn t want to smear his reputation or harm him i told him that he could reply or he could not and if he didn t reply i wouldn t bother him further today he found me via facebook and apologized the relief and the confirmation i felt was nearly overwhelming i spent years thinking i was weak dangerous crazy and unreliable but i m not i am sane i am strong i am dependable i do deserve the good life that i have,485,24,2039.193896
Why isn‚Äôt there a such thing as an urgent care designed specifically for mental health emergencies?,why do emergency rooms exist for physical or extreme mental concerns but there is no such thing as a walk in urgent mental health clinic i ve wondered this for years i ve always had a panic disorder during my first terrible panic attack at 21 i remember googling different mental health facilities in the area and limited info came up i ended up calling the cops because i was afraid and felt like i couldn t breathe but knew it was psychological the cops showed up and the only assistance they provided was suggesting that i sat in the back seat of their car i felt ashamed sitting there and as my panic dissipated i just remember feeling hollow and empty they couldn t help me and unless i was truly a danger to myself or others they weren t going to commit me to any psych wards so they left and told me some mobile counselors would be on the way eventually i went back home and sat alone for 3 hours trying to relax these mobile counselors the cops said they would provide me with decided to give me a call and ask if i still wanted help by that time i was fatigued so i declined that s when i came up with this question at that moment i would ve loved to just walk into a place and talk to a counselor on call not days or weeks of waiting to talk to a psychiatrist or therapist nor being committed to a psych ward just real people with crises that they need help with helplines in my personal opinion aren t the same type of treatment i ve only tried a couple though so i m not entirely certain on it though in some cases slight medication intervention might be necessary and personally i prefer a face to face conversation in addition if this concept could actually work what would one have to do in order to be able to open such a place,488,82,2081.772692
How do I stop creating fake scenarios in my head that upset me?,throughout the day and especially night when i m lying in bed i will constantly create these hypothetically scenarios that always upset me it makes me feel really down all day and stops me from sleeping i have a bad problem with overthinking everything and i think its joint on to that for example i d be sitting thinking about something normal then all of a sudden my brain would switch to what if this happened or maybe he she thinks this and all of the scenarios upset me because i convince myself they are true has anyone had any experience with this and if so how do i make them stop,479,66,1652.852669

Tonight we sat and cried together. I forgot I had the power to help people even when I‚Äôm sad. Words aren‚Äôt always necessary.,in my family we don t talk much tonight was a rough night as per usual i was sat alone in my crying and melting into my mattress when my mom came in i didn t bother looking up at her and just growled a classic go away in response she asked to borrow one of my books and i peeled myself off my bed to grab it it was only when i went to tell her to leave did i actually bother to look at her she looked like she had blown her noise a few times and her eyes were watery this was maybe the second or third time in my entire life i d seen this happen and i forgot how shellshocking it was to see your numbed parent like that this lead to a short uncomfortable conversation of me asking if she was okay we didn t talk much instead i just asked her if she wanted to sit on the couch with me and watch a movie i got her a blanket and some tissues the whole movie we just sat there at first crying and just holding hands by the end i still don t know what happened to make her so sad she knew better than to dig into my pile of mental issues but when the movie was over she hugged me and said thank you this is the happiest i ve been in a while i needed this it really took me out of my own bullshit for a moment to realize i had done something good just by being there and she had done the same for me in a way i could tell we just both felt cared for by the end and in my house that goes a long way don t forget how powerful small things are or that the people around you are often suffering too you don t need to be in perfect or even good shape to be the support someone needs also the movie was hairspray if anyone was curious,472,15,1487.495667
6 months clean from self harm!,yesterday i was 6 months clean from self harm most days i don t even think about it anymore i am really proud of myself for getting myself out of that sometimes i think about doing it again out of frustration or sadness or anger but i always think about how far i ve come and i can t let myself fall i still have depressive episodes but i haven t resorted to self harm life seemed unbearable not worth it pointless but here i am in a college i love learning to love myself and working to grow i made it and i hope anyone who is in the place that i was a year or two ago can get out too even if you don t self harm if it s depression suicidal thoughts anything things will turn out okay they did for me it doesn t go away forever but i am so happy to be alive to have this piece of victory to be in college when i never thought i d get there it s almost the new year and i m ready for it i am so ready for it and i can t wait until june 2021 when i ll be 1 full year clean i know i ll get there no problem,473,41,1527.002579

Last month I attempted suicide for the 4th time. Today I was promoted a week into my new job. It does get better.,i have struggled with mental illness my entire life i was diagnosed with severe anxiety as a child depression at 14 adhd at 16 and bipolar disorder at 20 the first time i seriously considered suicide was when i was 10 needless to say it s been rough the pandemic hit me especially hard in june i quit my job of 6 years due to the effect it was having on my mental health i was supposed to work at a summer camp in july anyways but the governor decided the day before i was supposed to start that residential camps would not be running this year due to me quitting my previous job i wasn t eligible for unemployment so i was no longer able to afford a therapist or my medication i found a new job in july but my mental health had declined to the point where i was completely unable to do it it also involved driving to a different facility every day which would cause me to vomit with anxiety before every shift after having a panic attack over parking in boston i ghosted them and decided that this was the end for me i couldn t do something as simple as sit and stare at a pool for 8 hours even if the alternative was an empty bank account and a rising self hatred how would i ever be able to function independently that night i attempted to hang myself obviously it didn t work and i m still here this frustrated me i felt like such a failure that i couldn t even succeed in dying i ended up relapsing with self harm and i spent the weeks after that consuming any substance i could get my hands on to numb the pain waiting for the courage to try again after the very much warranted disappointment from my parents i ended up applying for an overnight warehouse job for an online retailer from the rumors i d heard i expected it to suck but they were right i needed a job they hired me and i started last week turns out it doesn t suck and i don t suck at the job either within three days they asked me to apply for a promotion and today i got a fancy new vest my shift differential was bumped up by 1 50 and i finally have some hope for the future i also found out if i stay for a year they can help pay for my education so for the first time in forever i have a long term plan for my future best of all i can afford to get help again i know i m going to feel shitty again but it s going to get better again after that i have trouble remembering times like these when i m really going through it but for the first time in years i feel capable i feel like i can take it i m a hard worker and i m no quitter why would i give up on life like that i guess my point is that no matter how dark it seems how hopeless it feels or how incompetent you think you are there s always a chance for it to get better i m moreso making this post to look back on the next time i m suicidal but i m hoping my message will help others a little thank you for reading you can do it,462,20,1624.185311

I wasn't a troubled kid.",please read the edit for a brief moment in my life from ages 15 to the summer before i turned 17 i lived with my dad and his girlfriend my dad was a passive quiet guy that wasn t around much he didn t want custody but accepted to take me and my brother who was 12 at the time to live with him while my mom was in europe taking care of someone the whole situation was odd this woman let s call her c had an 11 year old son and was not happy about two more kids being added onto her plate my dad promised we were no trouble and that i was old enough not to need babysitting i was rebellious like most 15 year olds i was energetic popular and sporty i had just broken up with my boyfriend and i was just starting high school things are already horrible and to add a stranger to the mix was ever more shitty after we moved out and went back to live with my mother i was never the same person i told my therapist that i wanted to go back to that 15 year old girl again i was so happy and fun he asked me to describe when things changed and this all came up this woman legit abused me and nobody said anything nobody defended me and i blamed myself i thought i was troubled that i was difficult that it was my fault that my dad didn t like me i bleached the lower part of my hair and colored it hot pink when she found out she dragged me to the bathroom and locked the door and stood in front of it she didn t let me out until i cut the parts i had bleached my hair went from almost above my bra to shoulder length it looked horrible too all the while this large woman with shaved tattooed eyebrows stood behind me and yelled at me your father will blame me for this what an idiot i should just make you cut it all off either you do it or i ll do it for you i clearly remember shaking and cutting my hair she made me clean the bathroom explain to my dad that i had made a mess of my hair and had to do this and apologize for it she convinced my dad not to let me go on a 3 day school trip because she thought i must be grounded for a month because i had stolen her wifi password her stupid 0000 wifi password she said that i couldn t be trusted and how could my dad let me go on this trip so i was grounded and not allowed to go and i was the only freshman not there she took my phone and only gave it back when i called my mom crying about it and she had to have a fight with dad from across the world finally my dad decided my phone was out of the question the worst thing aside from the hair was when my friends and i decided to go to a party when i was 16 we got ready at our place and were just leaving when she stopped us yelling and screaming why would you think it s ok to leave my house looking like a whore get back here and then she dragged me back to the house and pushed me to my room legit attacked me and took off my clothes and made me wipe off my make up and change into something else my friends were frozen out of fear i came out looking beaten she didn t actually hit me though and miserable and crying i just told them to just go and we all ran out of that house i was humiliated i wanted to die my friends didn t know what to do one of them asked if she always treated me like that what a bitch that night she came into my room to let me know she only did that because she cares about my dad and what he thinks of her also that she doesn t want her son to see these things at his age she did that a lot randomly talking to me about what a great person she was and how wise she was once she sat me down to tell me i was acting out and that she knew i was a good girl deep down but trying to fight her and that it was natural she made me feel crazy and ungrateful she would play the victim constantly my dad was barely there much like before but when he was he was yelling at me because she d told him i was nothing but trouble she broke my spirit i was too tired to fight her i gave up fighting her i just legit gave up when i told these to my therapist he said that abuse is exactly like this they close a door on you but don t teach you how to open another one so you re just lost i needed someone to love me to pay attention to tell me i was doing a good job getting straight a s in school instead i got constant yelling and criticism and guilt i m 26 years old now and i ve just realized what this monster has done to me she s the reason my life is miserable now i wasn t a bad kid i wasn t a trouble maker i was just a teenager and this woman made it her mission to break me and she did my dad never married her and i have no idea what s happened to her i ve also never told my mom i mean she knew that i was having trouble but i never told her my side of the story i don t know how i m going to overcome this but i m done feeling like the victim i now know why i m no longer happy and care free and energetic i know exactly when things changed i m the same person i just had a door closed on my face and nobody showed me how to open another one i m gonna build one and walk through it now fuck you c i hope you get what you deserve i m sure she kept telling herself she was being responsible or that was her job but all she had to do was not ruin some kid s life important edit i just need to say this since this is getting some reads please please please if you just don t feel good that doesn t necessarily mean sad or angry it could just be out of it try and find the reason for it i ve tried for years i ve been in therapy since i was 17 and i started cutting myself i used to think it was because of guys or because of my parents divorce or because of x and y and i only realized what this was all about when i told my therapist that the last time i was truly happy was when i was 15 he made me write about every single year of my life and we went through it like a tv show and figured out what exactly happened i didn t even think of this woman for much of my adult life but now everything s a lot clearer so just please talk to someone write writing is incredible and it doesn t even cost anything but if you write and talk to someone who knows what to look for that s what matters,466,23,1656.443088
"Is anyone else disgusted by the way society forces us to ""grow up""?",for context i have antisocial personality disorder and the only human beings on this earth that i care for are my immediate family members i am disgusted by how society forces us to grow up because they force us to be away from the only people i care about we have to get jobs and work with others move away get married etc i realize the last two are choices but society still seems to see you as weird if you don t do them i m sick and tired of living in a world that wasn t made for me this is why i never vote neither political party is going to do anything that would fix my personal life because society can t function without people working and reproducing i don t care if society functions or not in fact i would like to see it all burn and i believe we should die out but no one else is going to agree with me,467,194,632.4787251

It's okay to be a male with mental health problems.,kind of an inflammatory title but it comes with a story and a bit of advice so buckle in growing up i didnt have any problems with mental health i was raised southern baptist worked on cars with my dad while still in diapers when i could walk i learned home improvement drywall painting ect i was raised to be strong protect my sisters and my mom i was raised that men dont cry men dont hurt i grew up thinking that i had to be strong in all moments and never let down my guard fast forward to 2 years ago i was driving home on the not so good side of town very very late at night when i saw a guy leaning in the window of a car drug deals not uncommon out in the open he turned away from the car and jerked violently before falling down onto the street i slammed my car to a stop threw up the brake and jumped out not knowing what was happening i always carry a firearm on me and had it on my side i approached the male laying on the ground when the guys from the car he was leaning in opened their door when they stood up the only thing i remember seeing was the barrel of their gun couldn t tell you what they looked like what color the car was hell even if it was a guy or a girl i pulled my weapon when i saw this and we both paused for what felt like hours days i wasnt breathing we just started at each other while i was aimed dead in that person s chest i didnt pull the trigger the person jumped back in their car and sped off after what seemed like an eternity and i holstered my weapon and ran to the guy in the street he was shot in the lower left of his back blood pumping out of a small circle wound holding pressusre on it with one hand and trying to dial 911 with the other i tried to stop and much bleeding as possible after hanging up with 911 the wait began i took my jacked off and laid it under him with it being cold out and him losing blood you want to keep his core as warm as possible help arrived almost exactly 1 hour later my hand had frozen literally frozen to this mans skin in a frozen seal of blood greg was his first name and he made a full recovery i moved on from that day different over the course of the next year i would have night terrors of the image of that gun the blood pumping out of his skin being alone with him desperately trying to keep him alive i couldn t be in public with out my heart racing and having to leave i didnt trust new people i was meeting i was scared to be alone at any times it came to a head when i tried to end everything with out going into it to much i didnt i went straight to family for help and explained everything my mom took me in i found a therapist that i enjoyed and got put on a medication to calm the terrors the first time i talked to the therapist i cried i cried and cried for the first time in my life cried like a baby and let all the manly machismo go i was vulnerable and she held me through it she understood and didnt judge she saved me one year of therapy later i have a totally different outlook on mental health after reading through this sub i figured this story could help someone it is okay for men to hurt it doesnt make you less of a man to be struggling with something it is okay to break down and not have the solutions please if you are someone who thinks you will be judged negatively for having something wrong or being broken in some way there is help i am forever grateful i found help when i did sorry if the story is kinda rushed or mistyped kinda a hard subject to bring up this is my first reddit account and i couldn t think of a better way to join the sight than joining a community designed to help each other i look forward to speaking with many of you,464,47,1894.179778
I finally got the balls to sign myself up for a therapist!,after years of suffering i finally got myself to therapy this has given me a significant dose of serotonin,464,42,2024.088227
I'm sick of therapists using CBT where it isn't helpful,i m getting really sick of people who are all about cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology and think having a positive attitude is the end all be all of mental health treatment there are many people who benefit from this type of therapy don t get me wrong but the people who are suffering most often see it as writing them off if you are deep in poverty in an abusive relationship jobless homeless or preoccupied with messages from voices you hear these methods do not work therapists need to take this into account when working with people who fit into these categories but also initially with all patients there should be an understanding that people aren t very open at first in therapy in general and could have any of these things going on and not tell you simply saying you need to change your thoughts doesn t work people may be in situations where their thoughts are about real problems they need to face every day i understand trying to make it easier for that person and that is what you think you re doing but really you are just making your job easier you as a therapist would be much better off starting with asking what kind of therapy someone is looking for and describing the different forms if necessary different forms fit different people and i m sick of cbt being the gold standard it really makes my blood boil when i hear someone say their therapist doesn t listen and most of the time it s because they are trying to use cbt and positive psychology where they don t belong sometimes life really is hard for that person and trying to get them to think differently about it is an exercise in futility people are often quietly in crisis and i see these approaches as inherently dismissive of this fact i hope someone sees this and knows they can advocate to their therapist for something different because i have had to multiple times and it is not easy,463,123,1364.412579

"""Leave your personal life at the door"" is so inhumane",has anyone else heard been told this before in the context of working one of my bosses said this recently about another employee why was having a rough time and wanted to go home and i think it s so crazy anyone else think it s callous cruel and inhumane to just expect a human being to stop being a human being when they get to work it s so fucked up to me that s just not how it works and that s not how we should be expected to behave and that s not what we should expect of each other so someone isn t feeling good so they want to go home early so what no business is more important than someone trying to make sure they don t kill theirself,465,113,554.8551255

The popular saying to ‚Äúfollow your heart/instincts/inner voice‚Äù is only helpful for those who have a proven track record of a healthy internal thought process. At 35 I‚Äôm learning that for me this is bad advice and I found that helpful to me to understand i interpret the world differently than most.,you know that cliche advice to listen to your heart or follow your heart when making life choices i feel like for me that is bad advice my whole life when i do this i find this was not positive for me relationships jobs etc my immediate family has several people who either meet the criteria or some of the criteria for personality disorders my whole life i ve noticed that when i follow my heart or listen to my heart i am usually wrong i have a habit of i misinterpreting behaviors of others and irrationally take small things as a personal attack on me which is insane i think this is rooted in my insecurities and deep down i believe everyone is out to get me or be mean to me unlike most people i should not follow my heart and actually use logic and talking to someone who is more objective than i am in any given situation i actually wish sometimes movies or people give this advice should say unless you struggle with your mental health and can t trust your inner voice does anyone else feel that way,458,35,1974.504084
I think I have PTSD from my wife giving birth.,let me start with i know that what a woman goes through in labor is incredibly hard and challenging on them both mentally and physically so my wife got induced friday morning and things progressed fine all day they gave her an epidural at 4pm friday and things were good around midnight the baby s heart rate dropped which caused my wife s to drop we had every nurse on the floor in our room in seconds they flipped her on hands and knees woke the on site surgeon and started prepping the or and a crash team they got her and the baby stabilized in about 15 min so that was at midnight she labored through until it caused too much stress on her body so they sedated her and put her on oxygen for a few hours around 4 am saturday she progressed to a little over 9cm around 9 30am saturday she gradually stopped having contractions and essentially going backwards they ended having to doing an emergency c section at 11ish when the baby came out he wasn t breathing and didn t for the first 5 min they had to resuscitate him all the while they had a hard time stopping my wife s bleeding so much blood it was all over the drs discovered some infection while they had her opened up and had to look for more infection which took them longer i watched them pull my wife s insides out asking for help with the bleeding and the nicu nurses flip my child s lifeless body around to get him breathing so i bounced around the operating room between my wife and child checking on them for like 20 minutes being completely helpless both baby and mama have gotten the all clear and are at home recovering no immediate issues with either of them i know it s silly to be upset because we came home and are doing okay when so many people don t get that opportunity i just can t get the or out of my head it s playing over and over very vividly let me close with i firmly believe nurses are a god send and i plan on seeking professional help this week just needed to vent,461,55,422.2092112

Is it rude to tell people my dad died by suicide?,my dad used a handgun and ended his life recently i ve found myself having to tell people my dad died a lot but i am increasingly wanting to be honest with how it happened instead of saying my dad died suddenly and unexpectedly i want to tell people my dad died from suicide this feels important to me if we are more open about suicide about mental health maybe fewer dads or siblings or friends will die this way i mentioned it to a coworker today who after i said it was suddenly in a rush to get off the phone with me i feel bad for shocking him and don t hold it against him if he didn t want to talk to me anymore after that but i don t want to hide how my dad died and i want people to know suicide is a real possibility for some,450,89,1793.229859

A place where men can freely talk about their problems, to reach out to each other and help each other.",i m looking for a few people to help me with this project to help run the page and help others out this year 3 male family members have attempted suicide luckily enough all three have pulled through but all three have all said the same thing i felt like i had no one to talk to it s been a little brain child of mine for a long time and i feel 2020 is the time and place to put things into action to help as many men reach out to one an other and get the help they need my logic behind this is that i feel people find it easier to talk to strangers online about poor mental health than to family members and friends thus the reason i want an online platform where they can freely talk make new friends get advice and get on the right path of being brave enough to talk i m looking for a handful of males to help me put together ideas and put things into reality asap if this is something you would feel like doing then please pm me,448,95,1892.073007

"Do you ever feel like you're just so, so starved for human connection",that like even when you re with people 99 of the time you re not really there and something in your heart is resisting you from being fully yourself so that you cannot ever fully relax into your being and instead are always as if holding yourself up somewhere outside of your body always psychically hanging on a ledge of fear that even when you re on your own and can be yourself youre still not really your self this is how ive felt for as long as i can remember the times when it didn t feel this way in my life have been as few and far between as sunshine on a cloudy day i feel fucked up somehow like this isn t what human life is supposed to feel like i can t imagine why human beings would exist to feel this way it feels criminal the only times that i feel ok are when i m stoned like right now and rarely when very comfortable with friends in a loving home environment i never felt like this once while i was living with my parents i gave up a lot to feel better i even quit my job and left everything behind on a spiritual journey and yet after a lot of enjoyable adventures i still feel the same like life is just a movie playing in front of my eyes as though a dream which i have no will over i never felt in control of my life really i have always been along for the ride of whatever my impulses tell me sometimes they boss me in positive directions and sometimes negative but at the end of the day i still feel like i m only holding on to the reins of my life which is living itself i don t stand up for myself when verbally attacked i just go silent and dumb i ve never been able to release myself completely to romantic love just half way never committing to anything that concrete just like i ve lived my life i don t know why i m posting this it s just a strange little thing that now i finally feel okay because i m stoned that this would come out that a healthier part of my is crying out for some help because it s never expressed and always imprisoned behind this sort of crystalline blurred window that seperates me from the life around me idk does anyone relate is this something that happens,453,53,1728.006839
My anorexia recovery,hey everyone so not many people know this but i suffered from anorexia for over 3 years of my life it took control of my life to the point where i was only existing and not living a life which was pretty shitty really back in april i decided i d had enough and wanted to get my life back i found my love for the gym i personally feel that exercise and finding a purpose in life can massively help mental health it s taken me 8 months to get to where i am and although i have slip ups which is natural and totally fine i m certainly in a better place than i was my aim now is to carry on improving and developing a better relationship with food exercise and life i suppose what i m trying to get at is that mental health should be spoken about and the stigma surrounding it should be broken if your reading this and are going through something shitty then it will get better and there is a way through it but please open up and talk to someone about your worries because it really can save your life if anyone ever needs to open up my dms are always open mentalhealth anorexia anorexia_recovery anorexia_survivor motivation my recovery,449,33,2203.649605

"Does anyone else feel like they sound overly dramatic/crazy when they open up and try to verbalize their feelings? Everyday thoughts that don't feel like a big deal, but sound like they are?",it s been a while since i really opened up to a professional because it made me realize how weird it sounds i just started rambling and it was like wow i sound like a stereotypical depressed suicidal person or i say exactly the things that abuse victims say in novels or on tv but i m not one i m not in such a bad situation and i don t have such a serious condition so it surprises myself i remember reading a patient psychiatrist dialogue in a novel and i thought yeah that s totally me then i bursted into laughter when they told the patient that they re seriously ill depressed but then again depression and anxiety is not a crisis in my case it s just my base level that i ve living with since childhood it s so weird to think how disturbing apparently normal feelings thoughts can seem to neurotypical people even showing self hate is enough to make people think that you re nuts yet it can feel so natural and like there is nothing wrong about it,448,18,2265.518899

Does anyone else just want to sleep to escape reality,my first post on reddit 39m i have always been of strong character and hard working people who know me would say i m life and soul funny intelligent and strong recently though i ve found myself slipping into a routine of staying up late and sleeping all day and being lazy i cocoon myself in my duvet and wrap a pillow around my head and try to sleep as long as possible i can wake momentarily and remember my dreams quite vividly they are always enjoyable happy dreams i can then just remember the dream and slip back into them it s like i m addicted to my dreams and as soon as i wake i try and try to enter back into that world sometimes i m successful but after 12 hours sadly i am in the real world i am in danger of losing my job because of this now which worries me even more it s quite apparent that i must be depressed i have so much to be grateful for but it appears the big d has taken over my life can i regain my normal life this is the first time i ve ever spoke about it to anyone probably the wrong place to seek help i have no idea i need to sort my sh t out before i lose my job and subsequently my house then i shall be at rock bottom,449,50,1884.283019
"High schools need therapists and real resources for suicidal students, not just non-suicide contracts",first time posting here please don t mind the rambly ness of this today i was thinking about something that happened years ago that made me realize schools don t do much about suicidal students when i was in high school i was severely depressed and going through a really difficult time in my life due to my parents divorce particularly after being sent to live with my neglectful and abusive dad i was self harming battling an eating disorder and was barely sleeping at night i was absolutely struggling pretty clearly on the outside i had a teacher tease me for looking so miserable at school every day and i got in trouble for being inattentive or dozing off in classes among my high achieving peers it was a rough time i remember changing a password to something i accessed at school to iwannadie it must have been flagged because i was sent to my guidance counselor who really only ever gave people advice and help with applying to college and she basically got me in trouble and threatened to tell my parents and made me sign a contract that i wouldn t kill myself it totally cured me of all depression and i was never suicidal again s anyway it upsets me that they didn t do anything more about this they didn t mention it to my parents or anyone else they never followed up again and didn t have a therapist or a professional to refer me to in school or out schools need to have a resource for students i was so vulnerable and depressed and i was shamed for it rather than helped guidance counselors don t really have time for this which is understandable but they must have someone else there to support students during tough times if that s the case,444,28,2113.129234
Social media is horrible for mental health but it's the only way anybody talks to me,this post is brought on by something someone shared about how you act during a mental health episode towards others and their right to be done with you for it as if we aren t suffering enough we have to worry even more than we do about the people we care about getting sick of us i m a 23 year old male who is basically a failure in the sense that beyond getting my ged hasn t really accomplished anything afterwards due to mental health spiraling i can t work and can t seem to get approved for ssi or ssdi it s gotten to a point where i m about to be homeless cause family has given up on me i have 1 friend and everyone else has left because they can t deal with me venting when i m dealing with alot diagnosed with depression anxiety bipolar bpd and cptsd it seems nobody around me tolerates the mentally ill unless they work 40 hours a week go to college etc i ve had people call me a mooch and that i m a failure to society many times honestly i m at the lowest i ve ever been and it seems i won t survive i have no support structure and am not in therapy anymore cause my last therapist gave up on me i always thought the us has come far in mental health stigmas but it seems only for those who benifit aociety,445,44,1500.071433

"You don't need to ""make the most"" of this global pandemic",i was doing some research for a project about maslow s hierarchy of needs when i got to thinking about how many people i know who are struggling because they expected their creative output to increase with the free time quarantine has allotted them but this isn t just free time our safety need has been completely compromised so it makes sense that creation or feeling a sense of purpose is difficult there s a reason safety is structured near the bottom of the period it s fine if you want to pass the time creating if you find escapism in art but be patient with yourself if you can t this isn t a vacation this is a crisis take care of your needs take care of yourself,450,27,1762.069558
Dear mentally stable people: I‚Äôm not lazy!,i m posting this here because i just want to know if anyone else feels this way i m not lazy i know it looks like i m lazy i sleep all day i never join the family to eat or watch a movie i spend all of my time in my room i failed my classes although i used to get straight a s i never go out anymore i haven t hung out with any of my friends in months i don t even walk my dogs or at least that s just what it looks like right i m not lazy i hate it here i m miserable my mind is in constant pain everything feels so heavy and difficult why do i have to participate in a life that just causes me so much pain why do i have to get a job when doing so causes a massive downward spiral in my mental health why do i need to keep going to school when it makes me feel totally and utterly filled with dread and fear other people want me here more than i do i feel like most people are given a shiny fun new toy and some of us are given old dusty broken shit from the thrift store and they wonder why we won t just play with it live a little have fun be happy with what you ve got enjoy it like i m sorry for hating it i m sorry for hating my life i m sorry my brain doesn t do shiny fun cool things and it resembles the broken toy a bit more people who have never experienced serious mental health issues have no idea what it s like for us if their toy gets a scratch they can polish it my toy is way too broken to even bother trying to polish it it s so invalidating and exhausting to even exist near people who don t understand because i can feel the constant judgement when normal people feel sad they can watch a movie or call a friend to cheer themselves up and it genuinely works for them i can t escape the brokenness of my mind even when i m happy it s always there and i can always feel it no matter what lately the weight has been too heavy to bear so i know it looks like it but i promise i m not lazy i m just trying to stay afloat,448,69,1781.077255

I am one day free of abusive relationships,so i 27m moved house yesterday away from my ex girlfriend who was emotionally abusive and controlling since we first started dating 9 years ago and only recently did i realise how bad she actually was we broke up about 6 months ago and have been living together as housemates till now and after finally moving out my sense of relief is so enormous i just want to cry even as housemates she was still super controlling and never gave me privacy or respect she d burst into my room at random moments without knocking no matter what i was doing she would sit on my bed uninvited and talk for ages about herself to demand my attention and i was called rude if my replies weren t what she wanted she d never let me have a say or input about anything that went into the house it was all just her decisions and that was final i ve just moved into a share house which i was terrified about since i ve never lived with anyone else before and my new housemates are really lovely and welcoming and it actually feels like my place aswell it s a weird feeling not having anyone to answer to any more but i guess it s the feeling of actual freedom after narcissistic parents who were controlling and emotionally abusive too its been a weird rough time getting to this point but my healing begins today and to anyone else that s around these type of people you need to listen to what your heart is telling you your more important than anyone else look after and love yourself first i really needed to vent this out and thank you for reading much love to all,423,26,1404.687637
I keep thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather die than deal with anything stressful‚Äù but I don‚Äôt want to actually die.,i always feel like anything i say or think is being dramatic like in dealing with jeckyl and hyde in my head i worry and stress about things that have happened will happen might happen might not happen or surely won t happen my day is consumed with these thoughts to the point where i get a migraine cry it out hold it in get mad i ve been on anxiety medication all of them off and on for years at the point now where i m too anxious to take anxiety medication because i m anxious to get side effects backwards i know i ve seen a therapist before but not for awhile i always felt like i was bothering them but i feel strange for being like this because i am 33 i m married have three kids a house a job a nice large family lots of friends and cousins and a dog etc and there s no issues but most days i end my day thinking i feel like if i just were to die i wouldn t have to deal with these feelings anymore and i d be free and that s in regards to my irrational worry and negative thoughts that i alone put in my head but i don t want to die i m afraid of dying actually i ve been fine my entire life except for when i had my second son 11 years ago he was born with club foot i spent all my maternity leave going to children s hospital for castings surgery etc he had an mri last year and got orthopedics he s fine and happy and healthy but since he was born i changed and i ve developed panic attacks anxiety depression ibs that put me in the er 4 times ulcers i worry that bad things will happen to me or my kids non stop i can t stop the play button so yes this is kind of venting but i m at a loss and i try not to talk about this with anything because i feel like i m being too whiny and dramatic everyone s response is always your son is fine now basically get over it but i ve always felt like i had some sort of ptsd i don t know if that s actually what it would be after my sons situation because i ve never gotten over what he went through and what i went through mentally and financially because of it any advice on where i should go from here or what i should do would be appreciated,422,26,1491.228611

Depression is not just sadness,a lot of people seem to think that depression is like how they feel when their favorite show ends or they get dumped or etc its not depression is losing the ability to enjoy nice weather its spending your most important moments your graduation your wedding your childs birth holding back tears of sorrow rather than joy its finding the tv shows books hobbies foods and activities you used to enjoy as boring as watching paint dry its feeling so exhausted you cant get out of bed for days its spending every waking hour just waiting for the day to be over its destroying yourself just trying to feel something depression is hell,429,50,1112.827315

Everyone cares so much about mental health until it comes to parts that aren't romanticized.,i m so tired of this i m mainly speaking from experience i know so many people that advocate for mental health but in reality they are just doing that to make themselves look good like they don t actually care those same people complain about their friends that are being too negative those same people brag about dropping certain friends because they spend too much time alone and never want to hang out those are the same people that are embarrassed to be seen with their friend in public because they have self harm scars and are wearing short sleeves they literally think that depression is just being sad and anxiety is like just being nervous about an exam they have this version in their heads of what mental illness is that s so far from what it actually is they kind of glamorize it in a way but there is nothing glamorous about having a mental illness again i m just speaking from experience but i know so many people like this and it really pisses me off they advocate so much for mental health yet they know nothing about it they don t even try to empathize or provide some support instead they actually want nothing to do with a mentally ill person they judged you and they just try to push toxic positivity onto you i recently got diagnosed with depression general anxiety disorder and cptsd i ve had friends call me gross because at one point my depression got so bad that i didn t showed in 4 days i ve had friends that called me dramatic when i almost had a panic attack in public i ve had friends that got angry at me for not wanting to watch a movie because certain scenes triggers my ptsd i ve had friends that judged for having suicidal thoughts and they told me that i should think happy thoughts or you shouldn t be so negative all the time or you should be grateful because your life isn t as bad as others those are the same people that are apart of all the mental health groups clubs at my school and they post all over their social media for mental health awareness month and suicide prevention month but in reality they don t care about any of that this person that i know that advocates so much for mental health once gave me a whole lecture because they thought that i was self diagnosing this was before i was actually diagrams with anything and all i did was tell them that my mental health has been really bad and that i ve been feeling depressed and struggled with anxiety for a really long time i had to explain to them that you can still struggle with your mental health even if you re not diagnosed with any mental illness and they told me that i can t say that i m feeling depressed without actually being diagnosed with depression i m sorry for the rant i m just so tired of all these hypocrites that pretend to care just so that they could look good and feel better about better about themselves,416,41,1384.816933
"If you were abused or felt unloved, unwanted, unheard or hated yourself as a child, please read this.",this is for anyone who was abused as a child or anyone who as a child felt abandoned unloved left out unimportant unheard or hated themselves even if you feel like your trauma wasn t as bad as others even if just thinking about your childhood leaves a bad taste in your mouth and you don t know why even if i can help just one person who is struggling please read this i wrote this when i had a revelation about myself i knew i ve been depressed my whole life i knew i had severe anxiety and i hated myself more than words can explain but i thought it was completely my fault that i was a broken person i thought i would never heal i thought nobody would ever understand me i just recently realized that my childhood abuse has completely shaped who i am as an adult i never before made the connection between my childhood abuse and who i am today it wasn t simply just a chemical imbalance end of story you may not have experienced anything even remotely similar to what i have but i hope after reading this some of you will start thinking and start seeing connections to your inner abused child that is still suffering from what happened to you in the past please google cptsd if you haven t already heard of it i m gonna vent about this because i know i m not the only one this is something that i just recently realized and it takes a lot of weight off my shoulders to finally know why i am the way i am this was really an eye opener for me this is my story tw the worst part about child abuse is for a lot of us we are too young to understand that we re even being abused especially in terms of emotional abuse we don t know any different we grew up being treated like this and we know something doesn t feel right but we decide it must be a problem with us we accept the love we think we deserve thankfully i did know that the physical abuse i was receiving was not okay but honestly it took me 24 years to fully realize that i was emotionally abused as a child 24 years i was emotionally and physically abused by my parents and other family members mostly my mother starting as a very very young child possibly infant of course as a child you are incapable of understanding that you are not to blame because of this i believed that i was broken horrible and stupid i thought something was wrong with me why else would my parents not love me in my own eyes i had to be at fault something was wrong with me even as a preschooler and kindergartener i have memories of thinking why do i have to be me and what s wrong with me my self esteem was non existent i remember going to my pediatric doctor due to a skin infection i had as a kindergartener i had to see this doctor weekly and because she was so kind to me as a doctor should be or any adult honestly i started to see her as a parent figure she made me feel loved and safe when my own mother did not i remember i brought her a picture of me that we got from school picture day she told my parents that i must have asperger s because of how socially awkward i was and how i acting around her the doctor this later proved to be false but again added to my feeling that i was broken and bad we stopped seeing that doctor and my parents were furious at me why was it not clear to this doctor that i was insecurely attached my self esteem and hatred towards myself only got worse as time went on and by 4th grade i was having full on almost passing out panic attacks started as hypochondria but quickly became social anxiety i could not function in school because i felt so uncomfortable in my own skin nobody wanted to be my friend nobody cared about me the teachers hated me and then at home nobody loved me when people would look at me i wanted to just disappear i made myself believe that i was incapable of making friends or being likable which in turn basically made me be unlikable ironic nobody wanted to be around me because my anxiety made me very awkward i viewed myself as lesser than everyone else which would follow me into adulthood eventually i could not talk in front of the class if i even knew i had to say a single word in front of the class or have everyone look at me i would literally run out of the room complete full on flight mode instead of being diagnosed with anxiety i was diagnosed with adhd i couldn t focus because i was probably always disassociating school was not the most important thing in my mind because at both at home and at school i was trying to survive why on earth would school be the first thing on my mind of course i fell behind in school and struggled to keep up with assignments which in turn made me feel even more stupid when they had psychologists coming in to my classroom to study me it only worsened my hatred towards myself they re only watching me and studying me because there s something wrong with me i started seeing the school psychologist therapist and social worker weekly i was put into remedial classes and on an iep i was placed in some classes with children with severe behavioral and intellectual disabilities i was forced to take iq tests in 6th grade i was literally forced to stack blocks while a psychologist watched i ll never forget seeing the notes the psychologist wrote after that lots of nervous laughter no shit i m 12 and you re having me stack 5 blocks in a specific pattern this is after they found out i had an average iq mind you everything that they did whether they were trying to help or not made me feel worse about myself why can t i be like the regular kids is all that went through my brain every single thing that happened to me only solidified the belief in my head that something was wrong with me i was embarrassed of my own existence when i d go home and try to explain that i would shake and be so scared that i couldn t even think straight in school my parents would just scream at me i remember getting punched in the stomach and told to suck it up after just trying to explain what was going on i had no one to turn to by 7th grade i could not go to school if i knew i d have to work with other students or even be looked at in front of the class i would skip school and honestly it wasn t that school itself was a problem i liked school itself i couldn t function with my low self esteem and hatred towards myself i constantly felt singled out i felt bad that other people even had to look at me i was too young to put this into words and all i was able to say to anyone about what was going on was that talking in front of the class makes me scared and shakey after i started getting in trouble for missing so much school after the school social worker and principal drove to my house to talk to my parents and do a wellness check on my family i went with extreme measures even running away from home and hiding which ended up with the police looking for me all because i didn t want to have to panic i tried to explain my anxiety in the best way a child can without even understanding what anxiety is i was treated like a delinquent child instead ended up in court after missing hundreds of days of school and had to do weeks of community service at 12 years old i was showing so many signs of an abused child and i had definitely brought up my family physical abuse multiple times to adults at school and nobody heard me nobody i was not a delinquent i was suffering so noticeably yet somehow nobody noticed by high school i refused to wear my glasses so i wouldn t have to see people looking at me in the hallway i was still in remedial classes all those years later which were mostly for kids with behavioral issues kids that would kick fight scream do drugs you name it this was not me at all i think i gave up trying to speak out because i tried so many times and i couldn t get anyone to hear me i ended up dropping out of high school fast forward to three years ago when i was going to pursue my dream of studying and then hopefully teaching abroad in japan saved up for three years for my student visa and relearned everything from the ground up to get my ged did both things got accepted and started my japanese school in tokyo never in my life had i been so proud of myself i didn t even believe i was capable of accomplishing anything in my life the moment that plane landed i cried my first ever happy tears two weeks into language school we were going around the table of probably 20 other students learning verbs at a very fast pace i remember time slowing down while i was waiting for it to be my turn then i blacked out when i came to i ran out of the classroom i left school and walked around tokyo sobbing i had gotten that far and somehow completely forgot how bad my self esteem and anxiety are my dreams completely clouded out the truth i knew i couldn t continue with school so i dropped out then impulsively blew all of my tuition money that i saved for years on bullshit after coming home i hit rock bottom and was hospitalized once again the belief that i was broken was renewed in my mind at the hospital i was told you re not severe enough for inpatient treatment the doctor spent a total of maybe 4 minutes with me asked me a couple questions checked me for head injuries and left i went to the hospital because i knew that if i went back home i was going to end my life i was so used to stuffing my emotions down into myself at this point in my life that even if i was on the edge of ending it all i looked calm i even explained to them this after waiting 6 hours after seeing the doctor they sent me to a place thats only purpose was to keep you from harming yourself great but when i went back home i learned nothing no coping skills didn t talk to a single mental health professional nothing i was back at square one i reached out for help for the first time as an adult and was again failed inside my head was still the once tiny little girl wondering what is wrong with me memories of my childhood were again flashing back i sat in my room for months i couldn t leave the house i had no desire to exist i ripped up

Threw out a self harm tool.,today i threw out an object that i knew i could hurt myself badly with it was extremely hard but i did it i ve been self harming since 2014 however i ve gotten clean and relapsed many times since then i recently have been self harming on and off since december and today i took the object i had been using that i knew i could do a lot with and threw it away outside of my home i did this so i can t go back and get it it was really hard but i knew i could do a lot of harm with it i hate hiding self harm but it s an addiction i deal with anything is possible even when things are hard know you can get through it self harm has been a major part of my mental health issues over the years the courage and strength it takes to get rid of something you can harm yourself with is enormous but if i could you can too,426,55,1616.923021
"Tell someone who is freaking out to ""take a deep breath"" instead of ""calm down""",i think telling someone to calm down does them no good they were already freaking out and stressing out it also doesn t do much when instead if you say take a deep breathe it s actually telling them something to do while it calms them down i find i get more frustrated and angry even when i tell myself to calm down i do this all the time whenever i see a guy or a girl freaking out and never get any push back for telling them to take a deep breathe just a helpful tip if you have someone in your life who tends to freak out a lot and gets tired of you telling them to calm down,419,47,1302.364699
My experience in a psych ward,last saturday february 27th was the one year anniversary of my ex cheating on me i had really bad thoughts about harming her like if i could end her life all my problems would be fixed see she was abusive to me and her cheating on me broke me mentally and sent me into a downward spiral that i thought was bipolar disorder i had spoken with both my family doctor and a psychiatrist and they both agreed that it seemed to be type 2 bipolar disorder so i started taking medicine for it now let s jump back to last saturday i realized these thoughts i were having were dangerous and that i needed serious help immediately so i told my parents to take me to the hospital being a bit vague on the details and they did i got to the er and told the nurse everything that had been happening and i was sent to a bare room with only a boxed in tv on the wall as an sihi meaning i was both suicidal and homocidal the doctors at my hospital evaluated me and sent a report off to a bugger hospital an hour away that had a dedicated psych ward for patients like me after 4 hours of waiting i got the news that this better hospital would accept me as a patient so within 15min i was in an ambulance and on my way to the psych ward when i arrived i was immediately taken to a room where my vitals were recorded and my possessions were taken away and i had to sign papers agreeing to treatment and their policies once i had completed the paperwork i was made to put on a pair of no slip socks for safety and was shown to my room it was a fairly bare room with just a desk to store what few clothes i could bring and two beds i had to share my room with a nice old man named arthur who was there for mild schizophrenia we also shared a simple bathroom with a toilet sink and shower the operation of the psych ward were fairly simple meals were at 7 30 11 and 4 30 and snacks were at 9 2 and 8 30 we had group at 10 3 and 8 where we learned coping mechanism positive thinking skills and did occupational therapy to learn healthy hobbies and habits to give us an outlet for stress and creativity they didnt force you to eat or go to group though some of the patients only came out for meals and slept the rest of the day most of us stayed in the common room which had a water fountain and tv we ended up watching hgtv or the food network most of the time we did watch some star wars too which was nice each shift change a new nurse was assigned to you and they were all very nice in my experience they brought me my daytime medicine right around 9am and my nighttime medicine around 8pm every morning and night your nurse would come to you and ask you questions like how your day was to rate your anxiety and depression on a scale of 1 10 and so forth your doctor would come around every morning as well to discuss outpatient plans with you to get you set up for when you leave the hospital as well as discuss or change your medications my doctor ended up changing my lexapro for prozac upping my dosage of lamictal and adding remoron to the mix alongside the doctor i also saw a psychologist who gave me a thorough evaluation he let me sit down and talk to him about my life leading up to how i got to the psych ward and he filled up 3 pages full of notes afterwards i took a 567 true false quiz called the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory mmpi and the rorschach test i was in the psych ward until today march 3rd before i left i had one last talk with my doctor who gave me a briefing on the psychologist s report it turns out i have autism specifically i have asperger s so that was a pretty big shock to me i think the biggest thing i learned in my stay at the psych ward was that the other patients are just like you and me they re completely normal people who just need some help none of them were mean or psychopaths they were all just average joes with bad anxiety depression and adhd i thoroughly enjoyed talking with and getting to know them so thanks for reading about my experience in a psych ward i will be more than happy to answer any questions you have,415,73,1462.372141
My depression is lifting. I haven't felt this happy in 3 years.,my depression and anxiety had its up and downs ever since i first started working it went downhill in march when despite having a great therapist and taking meds i got very suicidal i was on the edge of the subway platform i felt like a failure x200b i ve been on sick leave since then i thought i had disappointed so many people in my life but my therapist has helped me in forgiving myself and moving on little by little i decided not to go back to my current teaching position for the next school year which will cause financial instability but i m in such a better mentality being close with my mom she has noticed that i smile and talk more and that what she thought was normal stress was me barely managing my depression the past three years i was desperate to fix myself and to just suck it up because everyone has work stress x200b i have so much respect for teachers i am interviewing for other schools but i will most likely do a mix of tutoring sub work reception i am still sad that i couldn t push through another school year but i am feeling happier that i don t have to go back i have options and maybe someday i will go back to the classroom in the future i m working on hobbies i ve completely abandoned when i was working teaching is a huge commitment i have mixed feelings about my ideal work situation but i m glad i m taking the time to reflect and slowly plan my next steps x200b my meds and therapy helped a little but what i needed most was a change of circumstances i am only human it s still hard forgiving myself fully but i m trying,422,23,2115.142778

"I'm struggling with something and I'm not even sure what to call it, so please help",so ive struggled with mental illness my entire life since the 4th grade now 26 m i have anxiety depression adhd dyslexia and probably more lately i ve been experiencing these sudden bouts where i ll feel fine and i ll be talking to people and being social and once the social interaction is over or even during sometimes i get hit with this inability to feel happiness comfort or worthwhile i just kinda go numb in this existential void where i feel like nothing matters even though i know thats not true it kinda reminds me of when people run out of serotonin and or dopamine and can t feel anything but i didn t think it could occur so suddenly or depend upon social interaction and if that is the case how do i fix it please help i don t like feeling this worthless edit wow the amount of support this got and positivity has been amazing this is a wonderful community to share our stories and support each other you are all wonderful human beings and im doing much better now if i could i would hug all of you but i can t so please accept my thanks and this complimentary ghost hug you can t feel it but its there i look forward to paying this kindness forward in these crazy times,423,100,1667.794433
I understand why so many young adult men take their own life.,when i was a child a friend s dad killed himself and it baffled me as i couldn t understand why a man who had it all would feel that low but now i get it being a man is genuinely difficult we have no one to speak to about things that matter no one to hype us up no one that validates our thoughts and even existence and the loneliness is real even when you re in a happy relationship and being an adult in general is just difficult groundhog day every day the thrill of teenage experiences is long gone and the realisation that this is your life now and for the rest of your life you will live the same day over and over except everyday you re a bit more aged and warn down sorry i know this is morbid and maybe for the wrong chat i don t plan on doing anything drastic but life is definitely a challenge right now anybody ever experience this what did you do to help the feeling,421,147,394.154236

Held a child as he died,i held a child as he died yesterday i work as an emt b running 911 calls on a medic unit we had car crash with 3 deaths both parents and an infant the one child was still alive when we arrived we tried to very thing but unfortunately the child died i don t feel mentally fit to do anything at all i haven t eaten drank showered or anything but lay in my bed all of my professors have been very supportive and understanding except for my chem professor he said it s part of the job and my mental health is not an excuse to miss an exam i hate this semester update i ate today,421,73,686.5862383
Taking vitamin D pills cured my depression,just putting this out there my therapist thought i had depression i thought i had depression my friend made me take vitamin d pills as a test i m not depressed anymore and actually wake up with energy and excitement now vitamin d supplements are super cheap and you can even buy them on amazon consider giving it a try i noticed the change after only 3 4 days already but if you take any meds check in with your doctor or at least google to ensure it s safe for you to add the vitamin d supplements there s like three meds that you d have to be careful with as far as i know additionally if you re vegetarian vegan or just don t eat a lot of meat an iron deficiency could also be a reason for your depression iron supplements are also on amazon for little money hope this helps someone out edit as this is getting a lot of traction what this post was about is that my therapist as well as i thought that i had depression but taking vitamin d solved many problems for me a vitamin d deficiency can cause many of the symptoms depression does up to the point of a misdiagnosis that s why this post exists some people may be misdiagnosed some people may not even have a therapist to diagnose them so they did it themselves and rolled with it this post is a suggestion to consider the possibility and try something new to raise awareness that something that looks and feels like depression doesn t have to be exactly that it helped me and i hope that someone out there who s in a similar situation as i am was can benefit from the experience i had,416,116,1153.330625
I wish that therapy wasn‚Äôt so outrageously expensive in the US.,i m not ok i desperately need to talk to someone i ve had three therapists before but that was when i was a minor and i lied to them bc i was paranoid that they d tell everything to my parents now however i m 19 and on my own but jesus therapy is so fucking expensive what am i supposed to do i need to get back on medication and i need to talk to someone before i lose my mind but idk if i can even afford it gotta love the healthcare system here s,416,80,1634.796782
My parents had sex in the same room as me for 2.5 years.,it s more asking if it counts as sexual trauma this happened between the ages 16 18 my mom and step dad would regularly have sex in the same room as me the only thing stopping me from seeing it was a sheet that my step dad got mad at me for putting up at the time we lived in an off the grid cabin with only one room so like i don t know i just am disgusted by sex now but have always been after borderline witnessing my mom being sa d by my birth father multiple times growing up i just don t feel valid for how i feel because i wasn t actually touched my family has always been open about sexual topics too i think some people would think too open i m no longer in that house,421,115,343.8680091
Was anyone else called a spoiled brat growing up (or anything close to that) but now realize it was a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues?,tldr at the bottom growing up my mood was unpredictable it was a constant state of anger immaturity anxiety and fear my parents gave me stuff i wanted but were pretty ignorant when it came to my mental health issues they thought i would outgrow my behaviors or treat me the same way they treated my brothers thinking about it now numerous reg flags were there i was very defiant and scared of a lot of things many of them irrational i remember being in like junior high and my mother telling me to get something from the car while we were at a family friends party it was dark already and i took one look outside saw the car parked across the street and got scared idk of what but my mind told me to be scared i asked my friend to come with me but she didn t want to and i think she was scared too because it was dark i go back to my mom who is talking to her friends and tell her i m scared and friend doesn t want to go with me i don t want to go to the car friends mom was in the circle of friends like 10 of them and i was hoping she would make her go with me i know subtle tattletale in junior high too currently cringing and my mom ended up going with me to the car i didn t think much of this but the next day my dad told me that one of the parents called me a spoiled brat as soon as i left with my mom to the car looking back i should have told my mom personally but i didn t think it would matter since the people we were surrounded by were childhood friends who knew me at a young age growing up in my house was overall not good emotionally lots of instability with my father s moods and sometimes my mother s i ended up being a rude child and would get angrily reprimanded by my parents sometimes physically even if it didn t hurt it still did if that makes sense i remember saying goodbye to my parents friends at their friends house by just waving the off in an eh manner i tried to be cute and joke with them also i was half tired my parents pushed me to hug them and kiss them cultural thing but i was just like meh and didn t i didn t realize i was embarrassing my parents and their friends i came off as rude i was like 12 or 13 at the time as soon as we got into the car my dad exploded in anger and shouted at me to never do that again he said this while also putting his fist to my knee banging on my knee every time i didn t give a coherent yes to him when he told me to never act that way again i was in tears i really didn t think anything of my actions looking back yeah it is rude of me but i don t think they was the correct parental way to go about things there were many instances like this where i would come off rude and anxious especially when i didn t get my way with things forcing my friends to play with me when they didn t want to telling on them to their older siblings hoping they would make their sibling play with me only to be told she doesn t want to play with you that s not my problem picking fights with my siblings screaming and shouting loud enough that the neighbors can hear me i was recently diagnosed with bpd ptsd and adhd in addition to my mdd ocd and gad i feel like a light just switched on this year and made me go oh wow i really wasn t a normal kid tldr to a lot of people growing up i came off as an annoying and rude immature brat but after analyzing a lot of my behaviors and my upbringing as an adult i now realize it was possibly a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues,416,40,1769.978553
"If you were given the chance of not have ever been born, would you say yes?",if you were given the chance of not have ever been born and thus every interaction relationship and every word ever spoken from you would have never existed and the consequences that this may bring avoiding every ounce of pain ever inflicted to you but also knowing that all the good that you may have brought into this world as little as it may be would not be produced would you say yes this question is just out of curiosity as i have been thinking about it a long time now and can t really give an answer as there is so much to both lose and gain on both sides,419,203,1403.984687

Stop over-emoting at funerals and stop burdening children with adult emotions.,as a kid no one ever showed stronger emotion or openly cared about anyone unless they were in the hospital or at their funeral i never realized how that manifested my suicidal thoughts i ve wanted to die for the smallest things since i was in 4th grade after doing some personal development i realized that my need to be cared for was always associated with hurt sickness and other people were responsible to make me feel cared for teach children that they re loved their thoughts matter death or sickness is not the only way to feel cared for i now know why i always want to die if your loved ones will only care once you re dead what s the point of living lets teach our kids better love belonging and happiness is not achieved through hurt,413,70,1573.41618
Why does my (20m) mind immediately default to suicide when something bad happens to me?,i meant 20f and now i can t change the title i am very prone to spiralling or snowballing when something bad happens to me recently i ve been getting into arguments with my mum and it s been making me feel like shit she tells me i m brainwashed makes me feel stupid and a lot more when i brought it up to her she denied the lot and the only apology i got was a sorry you feel that way this isn t something small i don t think but i also feel as though i m overreacting but that just makes me feel worse and so the spiral begins and it always ends with a you should just kill yourself almost always followed with a no you retard thats a bad idea because other than little things like that my life is fine i have friends a loving partner long distance atm a roof over my head and hot meals i m fine yet i m not and again it makes me feel worse that there are people who have it so so badly and yet i have the audacity to feel the way i do i do not want to bring any of this up to my mother she would just gaslight me again my partner knows though and is as supportive as he can be in the current situation that s all i can ask for right edit thank you all for the advice and help i ll try to take it on board,411,36,1718.843842

A toddler said hi to me today and it made me feel human.,i walk around very self conscious feeling like a disgusting ugly monster most of the time i have a very rare disease that makes my body disproportionate and very unattractive and i have an ugly face on top of that this kid didn t see a monster he just saw a person it touched me so much that i cried thanks random toddler,413,38,2259.874873
Is it normal to talk to yourself?,i often find myself having full on conversations with myself or even made up people to get my thoughts straight sometimes i make up whole scenarios where i apply what i learn in life and give a bunch of advice to a bunch of imaginary people and i m not even sure why i do it but i do it a lot and it sometimes lasts a whole hour of me talking alone by myself in my room and i feel like if somebody saw me one day they ll think im crazy in my head i m having full on discussions but on the outside i probably just look like i m whispering and mumbling nonsense,416,98,1770.959803
The cost for inpatient mental health treatment is fucking shameful.,the average daily cost to be treated at a mental health facility if you are uninsured is 1 000 per day this is unacceptable and morally evil i m ashamed of the way the united states handles our health care the elite truly do not give a flying fuck about the lower classes,410,151,1877.876134
Anyone here indifferent to being alive but not suicidal?,lately i ve been realizing that i don t like being alive and simply not existing would be great but i fear death and don t see myself committing suicide anytime in the future but sometimes living gets to be so stressful and i break down sometimes and just let my basic instinct and muscle memory carry me through most days where i can simply dissociate but i don t have thoughts about killing myself or plan it out in any way mentally x200b tl dr i hate living but would rather not die and i am torn,408,65,2058.969352
Animals know,i had a suicidal breakdown last night i texted my therapist and she urged me to go to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation after coming clean to my parents about my intense suicidal idealization the crisis calmed down a bit and i decided that i wanted to sleep in my own bed i was tired and didn t want to spend 5 hours in the er waiting and to go in the morning i woke up this morning to my cat curled up next to me he rarely sleeps with me i think he knows that i wasn t okay he s like my guardian cat watching guard over me to make sure i m okay and be my companion so i could look over at him pet him and feel a small twinge of love for something happiness isn t the right word i don t think i m capable of feeling happiness right now but when i look at my cats i feel like maybe there is something even if it small that s worth living for my cats would be sad if i wasn t there i think that our animals know when we aren t okay,415,39,2112.334155
I fucking hate being told how ‚Äústrong‚Äù I am because of my trauma,my therapist said it to me in my last appointment and it just reminded me how much i fucking hate hearing it i m not strong just for going through shit if anything it s made me pathetically weak i have a constant sense of fear and dread in the pit of my stomach whenever i ve gotta deal with people and it leads me to either say whatever i think they wanna hear or just be immediately hostile with no real in between and as a result i have literally no personality of my own i m also not strong for simply just not killing myself every time i hear that shit it s always from someone who has no idea what it s actually like to be suicidal 100 of the time i want to kill myself there s no part of life that i enjoy or that i feel is worth sticking around for and yet i still can t bring myself to actually do it it s not because i m too strong or whatever it s because i m too weak i know what i want but i can t bring myself to do it outta fear that i ll fuck it up i m definitely not sticking around because of my strength i guess that to me hearing that shit is just a reminder that no one fucking gets it like 99 of people will just never understand and so they say stupid shit trying to be helpful and don t realise they re only really telling you how alone you really are there s nothing fucking strong about a man who s terrified of everyone who s constantly suicidal but is too afraid to act on it and who will never even get to see his own adult body not covered in deep self harm scars so don t fucking lie to me about my strength,415,73,1094.422454
People in their 20s: Ever feel like running out of time?,i always try to stay positive in front of everyone i know and most people around me thinks that i have my life all figured out but what they don t know is that once i m alone i get sucked into this deep hole of anxiousness and overthinking that keeps me up all night i tried seeking professional help but none of it helped me i kind of had my 2020 planned out but the virus ruined everything for me i wanted a career change because i no longer want to work for a job that was way too far my major plus it s draining and it s not really my passion and i ve always wanted to leave since the last quarter of 2019 i had no other choice but to stay within my present company cause i can t afford to lose a job during a crisis but i made a promise to myself to really stick to my decision and find a job that i m really passionate about once this year starts however job hunting isn t really going well for me and to top that i m doing awful at my current job maybe because i just don t find the joy in working anymore i just can t seem to focus also i started a small business just last year and it s also not doing well as of the moment everything s all piled up i don t what to do i can t seem to find something i m good at i want to leave but i don t have the courage to do so i want to do a lot of things but i feel like i m just so lost i don t know where to start how to start i just don t know,414,63,1510.145058
My dad saved my life and doesn‚Äôt know it,i 14m was planning on killing myself due to extreme personal issues in my life as of right now i was going to do it july of this year but it all changed when my dad called me into his room he asked if i was ok because i looked weird and wanted to know if i was ok and to let them know if anything was going on and if i was high i was recently suspended for smoking weed but even after i said i m ok it s almost like he knew something was going on because he went on a speech on how it s important to be with god he s very close to god and im not and to express your feelings but the thing that really got to me was when he said listen if you don t give a shit about yourself just please give a shit about us i can t sleep thinking about what s going on wondering if your ok that really got to me because i never realized how badly i would ve hurt my parents and my family if i would ve done it thank you for listening i just need to tell somebody this,407,30,705.432986

I think I was/am an unintentionally toxic person and its torturing me,to be honest i barely have any friends i generally can t hold down friendships for longer than a year or so i know that i kind of default to negativity when i m talking so that might factor into it i can be a little too honest sometimes i genuinely try not to be one of those im not mean you just can t handle the truth people but i m scared that i come across as really mean i can t get over the mistakes of my past where i did or said mean things in the heat of the moment or when i did or said things that were cringy or stupid sometimes i feel like i might have been toxic because i sometimes default to sadness when i wanted attention from others i put myself down a lot now i realize i do that so people would lift me up and i would feel good sometimes people would agree with me tho lmao i hate that i did that and some people might potentially see me as a manipulator even if i hate that and wouldn t consciously seek to do that i want to change and i hope i have but i m scared i ll always be a shitty negative person who sucks the energy out of the room and casts a shadow on everything how can you change your nature as a negative person and be better have you done this thanks for listening,408,43,1612.384826

Parents kept my mental illness a secret from me for 3 years. I had early onset childhood Schizophrenia at age 12. How do you think parents should go about breaking the news to a young child?,parents kept my mental illness a secret from me i had early onset childhood schizophrenia at age 12 i found out about my illness on my own about 3 years later at age 15 i was mad because they kept it a secret from me for 3 years it was 3 long years i was very mad when i knew the truth because they lied they did not come clean with me i found out myself i could not accept my own illness on the day i realized i had it it was a total breakdown being unable to accept the reality i found out about my own illness when i went online to find out what my medication is for i thought it was ptsd at first i felt like a fool they said it was too hard to tell me the truth because i was so young at that time they could not accept that i had schizophrenia at age 12 how do you think parents should go about breaking the news to a young child,409,92,1653.381586

Has anyone else been excluded their entire life,i ve always been the odd one out every situation i can think of school previous jobs friends relationships even by family people go places without me and it s been this way for as long as i can remember when we ve been placed into groups in school i always tried to talk to everyone but still i noticed they just clicked better with each other same thing at my old job i was just never good enough people don t gravitate towards me and never have no matter how talkative and friendly i am i m sure you ve guessed it by now yes i ve always been the therapist friend who never got anything in return now the one person who i m the closest with and love the most went to breakfast with all his friends and i was invited but he left without telling me the plans were still on and excludes me from other plans too now i constantly question what s wrong with me i always try to talk and include myself and it ll work for the time being but then i end up being excluded again i can t do this anymore,409,76,1706.235613

I finally shaved!!!,before anyone asks i am a girl i haven t shaved in months and if you re grossed out by that stop reading now i haven t shaved anywhere legs armpits pubic area it just seemed too overwhelming my boyfriend doesn t mind so my sex life didn t really get worse because of that and i live in a colder climate so wearing long pants during the summer was completely normal to be honest i kinda liked how things were less waste more time less skin irritation and stuff but i knew it didn t come from my worldview but from my depression shaving is the least important as i could go days without eating without brushing my teeth and showering so before i go on shaving isn t necessary showering is so if you re a male female whatever just don t shave if you don t want to it s not a part of hygiene you won t sweat more because of some hair but take a shower from time to time not a full on spa singing one hour shower but get in there for a few minutes even if it ll be just standing under pouring water but if you want to just like i did go for it i shaved my whole body today i used some coconut oil on my legs and scented oil under my armpits zero waste deodorant apart from that i also did a full on skin care routine and brushed my teeth and flossed wow i m sure most people do it regularly and it grosses them out when they have a single piece of salad between their teeth after a meal but for me it was a huge milestone i hope to do it again tomorrow without forcing myself i haven t felt this fresh and sexey in quite some time next goal laundry,408,38,1975.086574
"Mental illnesses do not affect us in equal ways, but they all suck.",my sentiments are based on being subscribed to the sub and seeing a pattern in which posts make it into my feed this is not an attack on the sub it s a suggestion to represent all the colors of the rainbow here this sub seems to mostly pay attention and support people whose mental illness makes it difficult for them to perform basic functions like getting out of bed i understand that life with mental illness is like a 10k race for those struggling with the basics every day moving a yard feels like a war against yourself but what about those of us who are sprinting i leave my house daily for work social gatherings etc but i face many difficulties each day stemming from mental illness i come here and i make posts about it hoping to find someone who feels the same who lives that struggle just one person who relates and reaches out and says yeah i m drowning in my own thoughts too or hey i used to struggle with that here s what helped me but i get nothing and i see no posts on my feed from others who live a similar struggle i m sure they re out there but their posts get buried or if they re anything like me they delete them later because if no one feels the same what s the point all the support goes to the ones who seem to be struggling the most outwardly it reminds me of when i was a kid and i had a troubled sister i went to school had poems put in the newspaper great grades and had a few short stories published in books but no one in my home paid any mind when i left for college i asked my mother why she left me to my own devices so often why she didn t put so much effort into me like with my sister she replied because you ve always done so well on your own i didn t think you need me that has stuck with me even to this day and that s how i feel about this sub the support isn t shared and i think we all could do more to make sure there s a variety of lifestyles affected by mental illness getting the attention they deserve no struggle is worth more than another but they all need some help,405,29,2141.328449

"You‚Äôre not a fucking manic pixie dream girl, and mania is not cute",just needed to vent this out really sick of the trivialization of mental illnesses but lately especially the notion that mania is cute or that being a manic girl is somehow attractive i currently intern in inpatient psych and the bipolar patients i work with often cause major destruction to their lives during manic periods it s just gross the memefication of mental illness is disturbing edit in case i was unclear i m referring to people who are not bipolar who romanticize mania when they do not have to deal with the things people who have the disorder do have to deal with edit 2 i realize the manic pixie dream girl trope was not an appropriate reference learned my lesson y all,407,126,2083.192477

Does anyone else feel guilty for their struggles with mental health?,ok i understand that guilt is a huge factor when it comes to people who struggle with mental health i have been diagnosed with did and severe generalized anxiety it has taken me years of medications various therapists and learned coping mechanisms to be the overall functioning human i am today everyday is still a struggle but i m at peace with that and just take things as they come the problem i have is that i sometimes feel like i don t deserve to have a mental illness if that makes sense i had a rough childhood but when i start to have a break down or anxiety attack i always think something along the lines of there are definitely people that have had it worse than i have and they are just fine or whatever is happening isn t as bad as what other people go through and i should just suck it up my rational healthy brain tells me everything is relative blah blah blah all the logical things a normal brain would think then my unhealthy brain just yells over the logic with intrusive thoughts that i don t deserve to have these mental issues because my life isn t that bad i feel like i may not be doing the best job of describing what i m feeling lol but can anyone relate edit thank you so much for all the comments and support it always makes things a little easier to know im not alone in this way of thinking i hope this posts helps others to realize the same thing you are valid you matter and the world would not be better without you in it stay safe and peaceful my friends,402,39,1691.712072

Mental health has no direct ‚Äúcure‚Äù and a lot of the times I think we have to figure it out on our own. Society doesn‚Äôt necessarily understand our struggle and we have to try and show them why mental health care is important.,mental health has no direct cure and a lot of the times i think we have to figure it out on our own i think the reason we have to figure it out on our own is because society and the health care system in place does not want to address mental health issues mental health is the most important part of any person s health period our mind dictates who we are and how we act this sub reddit is a good outlet to talk about what you are dealing with we care i care the government and healthcare probably won t look out for you we need to help each other always help each other through our mental issues so we can then help others through their mental issues that s love,403,51,1710.952674

To the teenagers behind me at the store,i m sure you thought the comments you made about me were clever that must be why you said them loudly enough for everyone within 20 feet to hear i assume it was super amusing making fun of me based on the giggles and laughs from your group behind me as i used the self check out for the few things i was buying since you lot are obviously comedic geniuses i thought i d share your wittisms omg why would she ever leave her house in shorts said by the pretty blonde girl whose shirt i internally admired earlier you were pretty spot on since i d hadn t worn shorts outside my home in almost 2 years i had finally found a pair that fit well and were long enough so i thought they looked ok thank you for disabusing me of that notion she probably doesn t leave the house often anyway maybe she s afraid she won t fit through the door one of these days said from who i assume was blondie s boyfriend well you were wrong about the door thing that s a full on exaggeration because even i know i m not that big however you were right about me not leaving the house often but it has nothing to do with weight it s because i m still severely depressed over the unexpected passing of my fianc√© less than 2 years ago look she s buying spinach i guarantee it s not for her this was from the brunette with blue highlights sorry to disappoint but it s totally for me why doesn t she just get that weight loss surgery she would obviously qualify from a different brunette well actually honey i already had it when i was 17 and barely qualified this was in the very early days of bariatric surgery and i obviously didn t have ideal results what s even worse though is it s left me with multiple life long health issues and chronic pain i ve had to have several additional surgeries to try and correct things with little success a lot of those health issues mean medication and many of those medications have weight gain as a side effect i also have hypothyroidism and polycystic ovary syndrome which both can cause weight gain as can depression which i mentioned earlier i d kill myself if i ever got that big said by blondie i guess it s a good you re not because no matter how horrible your comments i would never wish for you to feel like you needed to die and b i guess i m mentally stronger than you that s probably because of all the shit i ve been through but believe me there are often days when i think i d be better off dead and i d be lying if i didn t say how hard it was after hearing your comments to just make it to my car before i broke down crying i don t know why you all felt the need to be so cruel but i hope eventually you learn to have a little more empathy you don t know me or my story but you judged me based solely on my weight and found me lacking therefore i was worthy of your scorn your comments hurt and i imagine they will stick with me for awhile but they won t break me however someday if you continue this act you might end up being the last straw that does break someone i hope you never have to realize that your comments pushed a person to end their life and i also hope you never have to feel the way you made me feel today everyone please just keep in mind that you don t know what people are going through do better because not only is there no award for being a bad human but karma enjoys being an ironic bitch,405,67,904.9487962

Why do older generation people think depression is something we make up and it's just a western concept?,yesterday my mom was nagging me to tell her why i have been behaving weirdly i got fed up and told her i have been in depression for years and she called my dad well for starters they don t believe i m in depression because my face doesn t seem sad secondly i m not a doctor so i can t diagnose myself with depression and since i learned about depression from google apparently by reading too much about it my brain made me think i m in depression and that it didn t exist years back and it s just western culture and not exactly real when i told them a few reasons that included them they are saying this is what happens everywhere meaning this happens in every household and they don t see them depressed honestly i m tired but atleast after seeing me cry for hours they are searching for some therapists or psychologists nearby,402,124,1430.766782
"How do I explain my burnout to ""youre just lazy"" people?",not only burnout i also have depression i m 23 i don t have a job i could theoretically work a job but i would not perform well at the job at all and possibly get fired for being unproductive it would also do more harm than good to me but the main reason i don t have a job is because a job would drain my time and energy which i desperately need to work on my physical and mental health and also my to do list at home i just cannot handle any more responsibilities currently its too much im already fighting a battle 24 7 and i do not wanna attempt to work even harder than what is physically possible so now i often get judged you are 23 why dont you have a job or you should be studying you should why dont you but when i reply that i don t have time and energy for a job or whatever they want me to do they reply that i m just lazzy and privileged i guess that someone who has always been mentally healthy cannot understand what it feels like to be unmotivated to be physically tired or mentally to have a brain that does not function well to wake up tired even after 9 hours of sleep how am i supposed to reply to those you are lazy people,401,148,559.2804513
Anyone slowly realize they were very talented at something just to have mental illness destroy everything?,people who know me consider me very talented i mastered various hobbies in my past sport technical stuff and could have genuinely become a professional athlete or something else but mental illness has always got in the way affecting my self worth and focus so it was never long before i derailed or had a breakdown surely there are people who can relate after all mental illness is often the illness of intelligent people some say share your stories p s this isn t boasting i genuinely feel a lot of frustration knowing that i could have been happy and succeeding in life instead of causing people around me frustration and hurt i hope we all get better soon once and for all love to all yous,400,117,2444.002419

Self-care is not participating when you don‚Äôt want to.,there is power in standing up for yourself and sticking to your personal boundaries regarding how you participate in life as a trauma survivor i hate the constant barrage of showing up because of obligation fuck that i mean when i think about the fact that people will shame you over not doing something that you don t want to do i get irate i think about how many times in our lives that we are put in the position of showing up due to social constructs and i want to smash my face into the wall you don t owe anyone your time or sanity i implore you to please take care of yourself over the next few weeks starting today the number one thing that people healing trauma can do is to say no or to say nothing at all you don t have to go to family gatherings and events where past abusers are present you don t have to go to work get togethers because you are in recovery and tom can t have just one drink you don t have to go to the hundreds of things you are invited to why because you are a goddamn adult and you have the choice here no one is going to force you into a car to put the key in the ignition drop the gear to d and hit the road if i m wrong about that we have much more severe problems on our hands creating agency as a trauma survivor look here is the deal we are used to putting our needs secondary as cptsd survivors at some point our needs got put on the back burner as a survival mechanism that is ok we can acknowledge that however as we move forward we must follow our gut instinct and listen to what our soul tells us if everything in you is screaming don t go then don t go and don t tell me that it s easy said than done because you are in control y o u you have the power here and look i know that is scary but it s true you can step into your personal boundaries and your right as a human being is that you only have to do what you want to do i trust that the truth of our healing journey recognizes that we are allowed to have agency in our lives i challenge you to continue to double down on your personal boundaries and your right to say no hell start today no law states you must suffer through another family thanksgiving with your narcissistic mother verbally abusive step father racist grandmother or anyone in between today if you need to say no please say no order pad thai it s better than turkey anyway until next time my friend be unbroken michaelunbroken,396,27,1560.066088

How do I(22F) get over the trauma that a kid(9F) put me through?,i know i sound like a wimp but keep reading i am an mental health tech and my job is to basically be a glorified babysitter for special needs kids i m good at my job but something last night makes me start shaking when i think about it one of my clients scares me i don t know her exact problem but her father told me that her mother had done dope and drank alcohol when she was pregnant with her this girl was throwing a tantrum after we left a pet store she insisted that she held cats which we couldn t because covid first she whined then she cried then she snapped i had to call her mother and we stayed on the phone with her to get her to leave the pet store literally one step at a time when we got to the car she began screaming at the top of her lungs that she wanted my tablet to play games on i wouldn t let her because she already threatened to break it this lasted for twenty minutes i drove with her another client and my shadower new hire in training to the highway the girl suddenly stopped screaming unbuckled herself and got up next to me while i was driving 70mph she leaned against me and told me that i was ugly had no friends deserved to die and would kill me if i let her she began reaching for the wheel all slowly and dramatically like she was going to yank it into the oncoming traffic from my left side the shadower yanked her back but she kept lunging for the wheel trying to make us crash into the other cars i eventually pulled over on the side of the highway and called her mom the girl then opened the car door and tried to run out into the field saying that she was going to get us in trouble for losing her we dragged her back into the car and put on the child lock she didn t like that and tried to fight us once we got settled again when her mom finally came she started acting all nice denying everything that happened she took the child home and we took the other client home i forgive this girl because she has a mental illness and couldn t control herself yet i can t stop shaking and i couldn t sleep that night because i kept dreaming about deadly car crashes car crashes are one of my biggest fears i cant help but feel terrified when i even think about getting in one i get genuinely scared when i picture her in my mind and deep down i want her dead i will have to see her again only time i will be prepared how do i get over this fear that causes me to black out start trembling and cant form words correctly x200b tldr client almost got me and a car full of people killed and i can t get over the fear of being around her now how do i get over this fear and continue my job as a mental health tech,394,68,1472.914227

"If your compassion doesn't include yourself, it's incomplete - be as kind and understanding to yourself as you would be to a friend who is suffering",compassion is something we find easy when we think of someone we love but what about someone you find annoying or don t like if you think about someone you ve met who wasn t very nice to you or someone that was rude or did something you didn t agree with you might ask the question why would you feel compassion for someone who behaves this way the importance of compassion isn t only to relieve suffering and make the world a better place it s to free yourself from your own suffering your sadness your anxiety and particularly your anger when you see the suffering of others in their behaviour it helps to reduce your own resentments but where we can really struggle is feeling compassion towards ourselves when we re suffering we sometimes punish ourselves more for not being good enough compassion begins with yourself when you let go of the idea of who you think you need to be and accept yourself as you are it s an act of kindness that allows you to start to let go of suffering listen on apple podcasts listen on google podcasts listen on spotify other ways to listen,391,10,1551.184667
Has anyone else had depression and other mental illnesses for so much of your life that you feel like it's part of your identity and as much as you hate it you can't imagine yourself without it?,i m 29 at age 13 i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and about six months ago i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder i also get anxiety attacks sporadically but never been diagnosed with anxiety to my knowledge the first time i had mental health problems i was four or five years old i got put into a psychiatric hospital for a week when i was five don t want to get too much into why i was put in but basically i had extreme trouble regulating my emotions and it was at that point that i internalized the thought or message i thought i was getting that i was bad and wrong and messed up a year later my mom died from cancer and i thought i had made her sick because i stressed her out too much from being bad so again my vision of myself as a bad person was heavily internalized and confirmed then i went through bullying and teasing at school from age 8 to 12 because i was fat from comfort eating because of losing my mom and awkward and every demeaning thing the bullies said just confirmed my belief in myself being a disgusting ugly embarrassing pathetic piece of trash around age 10 was the first time i wanted to die age 13 i was hospitalized again for being suicidal i ve been on about 10 12 various medications at different times since i was 13 trying to treat my mental health i have done probably 10 years of weekly therapy appointments and despite all that nothing helped me 100 or even 50 i still was depressed and anxious i developed an eating disorder that went in and out of my life for 10 years i still hated myself and had very low self esteem and self injured and felt suicidal and just dark at 29 i still feel like i m just destined to be this way my biological father died from alcoholism after having it for about 35 years and he also had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder recently before he died my mother s side of the family had depression and anxiety and food addiction i just feel like i m destined to be and stay mentally ill and i feel like it s part of my identity ever since my mom died i ve gone through life feeling isolated and different from everyone else around me i feel i m just a broken person and i ve felt it so long i really internalized it at a very early age i know it sounds ridiculous but since the dark self hating self sabotaging thoughts are all i have known for practically all my life they are comforting to me in a strange way it feels right to just wrap myself up in a blanket of sadness and turn my back on the world i can t see myself being any other way i feel like it s formed my personality i m not really sure i just at this point in my life i can see how not fixing my depression and other issues will leave my life in ruins and possibly end with me dead by suicide or reckless behavior or long term hospitalized obviously neither of those i would like but another part of me feels indifferent to that happening like meh you re a piece of shit and so messed up anyways you re just another human out of the billions of others contributing to the demise of this planet so it really wouldn t be a big deal and would be better in the long run i ll end here before i continue rambling on basically i feel like being mentally ill is embedded into my dna and is in every part of me and i can t find the motivation to try to change it or even the belief that i deserve that change or that it will even ever happen additionally i feel like i have no idea who i would be without it has anyone felt this can anyone relate,397,45,1921.994089
"Six months after my suicide attempt, I‚Äôm traveling alone and loving life.",almost exactly six months ago i tried to take my life i was misdiagnosed with mdd but after my attempt and hospitalization was diagnosed with bipolar disorder i was put on new medication started therapy moved to a new apartment and generally hit the reset button on my life now i m traveling europe alone for the first time i m doing what i want when i want meeting new people seeing things i never thought i d see and loving every minute of it every second i think about the fact that i could have not had this opportunity i could have cut my life short and never been to europe never felt the freedom of standing at the top of a waterfall in iceland or on the river thames in london i m so thankful that i made the call before it was too late and that i had people in my corner when i woke up in the emergency room that cold march morning i m glad that i chose life despite how hard it can be how cloudy and dark and hopeless it is at times i m glad that i sought help and got the help that i needed i still feel hopeless and lost and miserable sometimes we all do but i want every person here to take a deep breath before they consider ending their short beautiful life too soon you never know what more there is to see and feel and experience i love myself now and i love you all cheers xx edit thank you all for your support i wanted to clarify that i wasn t meaning to brag or seem like i just dropped everything and hopped on a plane i actually planned this trip back in january before my attempt which perhaps makes it even more profound i was tempted to cancel the trip during my treatment and recovery but after six months i m finally trusting myself again and feeling connected to myself and the world around me getting on the plane felt terrifying but i m so glad i went through with something that is good for me mentally emotionally and spiritually it s a chance to sit with my thoughts and take in the world around me my eurotrip can be your anything going somewhere new or sitting in a park you pass everyday i just want you to feel as alive as i do much love,393,24,1986.915605

We need to change the way we talk about anxiety and depression.,i think we need to change the name of anxiety and also depression so that they sound as serious as they are so many people just completely brush off these serious mental health issues because they are so common thinking that feeling depressed or a bit anxious is the same as a full blown mental illness telling someone you have depression or anxiety feels like it has the same impact as telling someone you have a cold it needs to be talked about in a more serious manner so that people suffering from these sometimes life ruining mental illnesses don t have to be ashamed pretty much every person i have spoke to who has or did have clinal depression including myself say that they often feel guilty they have thoughts similar too other people have it so much worse than me or im just over exaggerating this is not how things should be people shouldn t have to feel bad for being in pain think about it this way you dont see a guy with a broken leg feeling guilty about having broke his leg no he goes to the doctors gets help lets it heal and will likely receive get well soon letters from family or friends why does the same not happen with a broken mind if everyone in a community can realise how serious anxiety and depression actually is then they can empathise with those who suffer helping millions of people who s lives are a constant struggle to at least feel a little bit more understood accepted by their peers and less guilty that to me would be a massive step in the right direction ps mental health in general needs to be spoken about a lot more i just talked about anxiety and depression in this because i feel they are considered less serious than other mental illnesses by many thank you for reading,390,44,1764.377515

My wife compared having sex with me to self-harm. I feel like there is no hope left for me.,my 34m wife 38f recently said something that has devastated me we ve been together for 12 years we are each other s first and only relationship on and off again for the last two or three years we have been going to couples counselling because i often feel like she isn t attracted or interested in me and sex is non existent in our marriage she was having a bad day a few weeks ago and came to me to ask for sex surprised i asked why now she never wants sex her response made me want to vomit she said since she can t cut or self harm herself like i have to myself she has sex with me instead she compared sex with me to self harm i understand that i am not a catch when it comes to relationships or life i have struggled with my self esteem for a long time as a child i was diagnosed with the r word autism pdd epilepsy multiple learning disabilities and a speech impairment my diagnosis paperwork includes phrases like unlikely to succeed at life i m not the smart kind of autistic i fail at school and struggle with the everyday things that come naturally and easily for everyone else it feels overwhelming trying to conform to neurotypical standards consequently i have struggled with major depression psychosis and self harm moreover i am an ugly person i have bad acne possibly hidradenitis i have crooked teeth i am overweight and i have enough scars from self harm to frighten most people on sight despite all this i am making a real effort to be better i will be seeing a new dermatologist in june i might be able to afford braces in a year or two i exercise regularly and i have so far lost between 50 60 lbs in the last two years not enough but i am trying i see a therapist 1 2 times a week what s the use in any of this if i am so horrible of a person that sex with me is comparable to self mutilation i feel like i might as well give up now how will working out at the gym fix this how will therapy fix this i m so bad that sex with me is the equivalent of self harm i feel like i might as well just unalive myself it worked for my father and father in law i can t process there being anything more wrong with me than what there already is i m fat ugly r word and apparently the only woman to have had sex with me compares it to self harm wtf am i supposed to do about all this,387,94,42.2528039
"Being lonely in the 21st Century where we are living in a super-connected world is fricking hard, mentally taxing and it burns me out",to avoid getting into the details i have to build a thick wall around myself because i have been struggling with multiple mental health issues for pretty much all my life but slowly and surely i have been gathering strategies techniques and other methods on how to deal with them even though the amount of effort and time that it took me was way longer than i waited for them to be and i still have a lot stuff to delve into in order to master these strategies over the years i have been learning how to break that thick wall that i built over the years and slowly creep into the dark unknown and face these demons and even face the real world due to that my experiences has left me with a scared and scarred image of the world but for some reason dealing with loneliness is perhaps one of the most exhausting nerve wrecking and humiliating war that i had to fight through i am well aware that loneliness is not easy to deal with it is a mentally tricky thing to face and counter and can lead to so many other traps and other complications and difficulties that you sometimes become stuck in a maze or a in a super thick and sticky web of different threads with different poisons slowly sucking away what is left of your blood soul and health it is a double edged sword that you want to get out of this invisible prison but at the same time the prison is also your only home and walking out of it is very scary and the fear of being rejected even if you try to be as friendly as possible is very tough to overcome x200b the person few years i had to really pull myself from my bootstraps to overcome the traps of loneliness the fear of being rejected the neediness of attention and the appropriate social skills for different situations yet for some reason as much as the world of today should be able to allow me to use the resources that we use today like social media to my advantage to reach out but in reality it is often the opposite x200b i know that social media is a big joke and a trap of itself where behind every smile and photo of the last party dinner or get away that you want to hides a dark thing that you do not want to share to the rest of the world yet at the same time seeing the sheer amount of photos and posts where i see smiles and even laughs with other people friends or even random strangers it makes me feel angry and pathetic with myself desperate to do something about it i reached out plenty of times with other people but more often than not communication in the 21st century makes us more alien than connecting to one another it is super easy to ghost someone nowadays or leave a seen without even giving a clear reason why or giving the cold shoulder because the person you are talking to is simply a stranger or you do not like for no reason whatsoever i constantly feel that i do not know where i am with another person it is humiliating and nerve wracking and it burns me out it makes me feel pitiful petty little it makes me feel less of a human being and like i am being passively aggressively bullied x200b yet it is also pretty hilarious that the technology of today is supposed to make us more connected yet it makes it too easy to push people away why is it common to leave only seen almost after every message why not just speak from the heart or just say a word anything i feel humiliated and angry and constantly going through a thick and mighty storm every day to keep myself sane throughout this process and it feels like i am going around in circles or walking inside a maze where i have no idea where i am going i know that loneliness is also in my head even though my mind and body have real reactions to the feeling but this feeling is incredibly overwhelming and when i try to reach out nobody is available or i have to be very careful of what to say to others as though i am walking on eggshells because of random excuses like being busy or unavailable and or whatever excuse they can think of to avoid contact,386,13,1694.434459

I don‚Äôt give a shit if someone is ‚Äúfaking‚Äù anxiety/depression.,disclaimer this isn t targeted at any one individual or group but rather a school of thought that seems to have penetrated everyday discourse surrounding mental health if i say you or you people i m referring to people who subscribe to the bullshit thinking i m about to outline this was meant to be posted to r unpopularopinion but got deleted so i figured y all could appreciate my sentiment instead it seems like whenever i see a post about mental health outside of subs that are directly related to the concept the same point comes up duh like 90 of people who say they have depression are just faking it for attention all those kids on tiktok just want to larp as billie eilish and pretend they have a mental illness so they can be trendy just stop and i say this as someone with diagnosed depression anxiety and adhd here s why this way of thinking is complete and utter horse shit first off depression anxiety are incredibly common and exist on a wide spectrum of severity when people see someone who claims they re depressed but still manages to go to work school without many problems they automatically jump to the thought of oh well they seem to be doing pretty well they re not really depressed this is such bullshit because unless you ve advanced science by 5 decades and figured out how to read someone else s thoughts you don t know what the fuck they re going through even if that normal person seems functional there s no telling what s going on in their head you think everyone who has real depression is a lifeless sack of garbage who sits in bed crying all day guess what there s probably a handful of people at your job in your class that have real depression they just hide it well because that s what people with mental health issues have to do in order to succeed second on the flip side of the coin so many people assume the complete opposite this person has depression and adhd but doesn t take care of themselves and can t hold down a job without breaking down god another faker huh that s not mental illness that s laziness like what the fuck is wrong with you that s literally what severe mental illness does to you if depression can t exist if you re doing well on the surface and it also can t exist if you re doing terribly on the surface then what the hell do you think depression is but even putting aside the obvious lack of understanding regarding mental health it s still fucked up to call someone out as a faker look at it this way let s say someone actually is faking it they post on social media claiming they have depression but they actually don t who fucking cares even if they don t have a diagnosed mental illness they clearly aren t getting the attention they need outside of social media and since when is asking for attention a bad thing most of the people who receive these complaints are literally children you think that if a fucking child is resorting to random strangers online for support there s absolutely nothing wrong with them and they don t need people to hear them out of fucking course not and here s the biggest problem who are we to decide whether someone is faking or not mental illness transcends class race and gender nobody is immune from chronic depression anxiety 99 of the time you cannot fucking tell if someone has a mental illness or not because it s a m e n t a l illness so why take the chance on saying oh they re just lying for attention when there s a strong possibility that they re serious and you re just making it worse by making them feel like an impostor seriously what does anyone stand to gain from calling someone out for faking it oh but the more people who fake it the more stigma there will be against people who have actual mental illness bull shit where do you think that stigma is coming from because it sure as fuck isn t coming from people who actually care about mental health it s coming from people like you who refuse to believe that mental illness can affect everyone no mental health professional or doctor or caring person is shutting these people down it s just people like you the resources to treat mental health are always available but people who need them aren t getting them because they re constantly told that they re making it worse for people who have real mental illness and one more thing oh you probably self diagnosed didn t you that means your mental illness isn t real oh fuuuuuuck off first of all how do you think you get a diagnosis in the first place you think a doctor is gonna come to your house take one look at you and say yep you ve got depression that s not how it works you get a diagnosis by recognizing symptoms within yourself condensing them and narrowing it down to a few possibilities then bringing that info to a professional when if you can this process is known as you guessed it self diagnosis and what about people who can t get diagnosed i m lucky enough to live in a place where mental health is taken seriously and covered by insurance so i was able to be diagnosed and treated from a young age what about people who aren t so lucky in the us you can pay up to 500 for an initial consultation not everyone can afford that and in some countries mental health treatment is a fucking joke it s chocked up to weakness or insanity sometimes so good luck getting a diagnosis in one of those places and actually getting a prescription for meds that s a whole other mountain to climb even in more progressive countries so if you re in an area where getting a diagnosis is next to impossible what are you supposed to do just sit there feeling miserable and telling no one because you might be faking it fuck no you get online and do what you can to find support and raise awareness for others in your situation bottom line nobody knows what mental illnesses someone else is or isn t dealing with and even if you do why the hell do you care you re not helping anyone you re not saving resources for people who actually need them all you re doing is making everybody feel worse,377,64,1282.229494

"Does anyone else hate how people throw around the terms ""narcissist"" and ""sociopath"" on Reddit?",narcissistic personality disorder is a horrible painful condition it s a mental disorder that just like any ruins the lives of people who never wanted to be this way like other personality disorders it takes away someone s control over their own thoughts and behaviours and twists their perceptions of the world around them they ve quite often been through abuse which has led them to develop their condition and often they aren t even able to see that there s anything wrong just like in other psych conditions sociopathy hasn t even been considered a real diagnosis for decades the closest thing is antisocial personality disorder which is another horrible condition that people are forced to live with it damages someone s ability to empathise and feel positive emotions their ability to control strong bursts of anger or sadness and to properly deal with their emotions and it makes people struggle to control impulsive behaviour and fit in with society someone with aspd isn t the stoic emotionless killer from a horror film or the cool charismatic cunning ceo in fact they re very often poor and not too clever having grown up in toxic environments and never getting the support they need to develop properly both of these conditions are extremely complex and very very hard to identify and diagnose even for an experienced psychiatrist sitting across from their patient reddit uses these terms the way people used retarded a decade ago people have taken crippling conditions that they know fuck all about beyond watching slasher films and dr phil and turned them into slurs it s even worse just how readily people make these armchair diagnoses whenever anyone does something bad they must be a sociopath it couldn t just be that normal people like you and me sometimes do bad things for a variety of very complex reasons no they must be a sociopath and that means monster whenever a r relationship_advice or r amitheasshole post describes someone doing something that could even just be interpreted as slightly unreasonable or a slight overreaction they re a toxic narcissist no they didn t just snap because they ve been under a lot of stress like any human can they dont just seem unreasonable because we don t know what s going on in their head and know their side of the story no they re a narcissist and it seems everyone on reddit knows at least one narcissist usually more and how do you deal with someone who has a debilitating mental health condition you cut them out of your life completely after all they re toxic and they ll ruin your life if you let them tl dr narcissist and sociopath are the new retard and it s disgusting,381,84,2171.257214

my brain tries to convince me that everyone secretly hates me,i was diagnosed with social anxiety 4 years ago lately i ve been noticing that after social interactions i can t stop thinking about the ways i messed up and even though i m able to convince myself logically that it wasn t that bad and that people don t hate me for it i keep thinking that they just pretend to like me and secretly think i m a terrible person i can t stop beating myself up over minor mistakes and i try to distract myself from these thoughts but they always come back and then they won t leave me alone i ve talked to others and asked for their assessment of the situation that i currently can t stop thinking about and they reassure me that it s not that bad which helps for a while but then i go back to thinking that i made a horrible mistake and people are lying to me when they say it s okay this happens with things that happened years ago or when i was a child too it s keeping me up at night it makes me feel physically sick it makes it hard to eat and makes me angry because i m trying to get better i m trying to put myself out there and overcome my fears but as soon as i m alone with my thoughts it backfires i wish i had a healthy brain,377,68,1662.992179

"Does anyone else struggle with ""feeling stupid"" all the time?",here s how i would describe it picture that emptiness you feel in your stomach when you are hungry or right after a long toilet break i constantly feel that emptiness in my head i just feel stupid i forget things right after studying them sometimes i can t study at all without getting distracted i suck at math and sometimes i struggle with putting together a cohesive sentence or even writing a single word properly it s like being high all the time i try to fight this feeling by playing memory games drinking a lot of coffee and reading lots of non fiction books but nothing helps i should also point out that i don t have any diagnosed mental or cognitive illnesses in a recent iq test i scored 109 even though the paper specified that the results might be a bit inaccurate since my scores to each section of the test were very imbalanced meaning that i could be a genius when it comes to logic but a dumbass when it comes to memory either way they didn t specify nor did they tell me if the actual results are likely higher or lower this is very demotivating it makes me abstain from studying thinking that i will immediately get distracted or forget everything once i finish reading is there a way to fight this feeling,375,33,1851.208846

Can we please stop normalizing and agreeing with suicidal people in this sub?,it is actually starting to hurt my heart with the amount of people in this subreddit who agree with ops i understand most of us feel suicidal myself included but why go out of your way to agree with someone and give them further reason to end it this is literally a support page for people who feel suicidal at one point in time this was my last resort and i guarantee if i didn t have someone that actually gave a fuck i would ve done it some of you need to look in the mirror and realize that maybe you re contributing to it it almost seems like this is a place to encourage suicide at this point i love every human on the face of the earth and i d be willing to bet i m not the only one that feels this way about the current state of this sub if anyone reading this is feeling suicidal message me i m an emt with background in psychiatric emergencies i want to help you feel better instead of saying oh yeah i get what your saying there really is no point holy fuck this sub makes me lose hope in humanity daily we re supposed to help eachother not encourage it do better,372,70,807.7606512

Ignoring Instagram for the sake of your Depression,hey guys and girls in the last time i m again at a very low point of my life and deep depression i noticed that my feelings get worse when i m scrolling through instagram seeing the posts and lives of other people and friends i know it s not always the whole reality they show there it s only the best part they post often with big theatre to have a worthy post that s life today still i feel so bad seeing other people being with other people together having fun which remembers me that i should do the same but i m not able to have much joy due to my depression and social anxiety then i feel guilty and worthless who else here has the same experiences did anyone of you quit or at least ignore instagram for a time and saw definite positive improvements in their mental health i think i won t delete instagram as it s something a bit important like whatsapp well ok it s not even near as important as whatsapp but i don t know i probably would miss some things as i already deleted snapchat years ago and people tell me oh you missed this and that i sent you but that s no problem for me whatsapp instagram is enough of the always online always having to present the perfect life bullshit i would love to read about your experiences and suggestions much love to everyone with depression it s only the brain telling us false things and emotions it s not reality i have to remember myself every time again it s so hard when you already get fucked by your own mind with negative thoughts about the most irrational things just waking up right in the morning,374,72,1585.47167
This sub is flooded with people asking for help with no one there to give it.,i looked for a sub about mental health because i m struggling with my own issues just like everyone else here i started reading people s posts and felt like i couldn t stop a lot of people are saying they re blown away by the amount of people on here asking for help so i know i m not the only one who notices this only most posts have little to no comments at all no support the shit is so taboo that even in a sub labeled mental health we still can t bear to talk about it with each other you guys posts are so raw and sad that i couldn t even write about my own problems i feel really cheesy and sad right now but maybe what we need is to help each other we are all here because we seem to hate ourselves our lives etc and can t live with it anymore but what if you could help someone else get them through the night make them feel better does that matter to anyone i don t know about y all but i don t matter much anymore but other people still matter to me if i could help just one of you it may put a small piece of me back together make me feel like some of the wrong i ve done is being countered maybe it could put some of you guys back together too,373,66,2005.748556
33 m. I had sex with my therapist after two years of being treated for Borderline Personality Disorder.,so this is a long one going to try and keep it short and be available to answer questions two years ago with nearly 20 years of mood swings sadness anger substance abuse and hyper sexual behaviors behind me i decided it was time to get help my wife of 8 years was asking for a divorce and my life had become unmanageable i started seeing a psychologist through the va i m an army veteran she turned out to be a specialist in bpd and after some time was able to diagnose me i had always suspected either bpd or bipolar we ve worked together for about 2 years and have made amazing progress she leads a dialectic behavioral therapy group that worked wonders for me it was life changing emotional intelligence mindfulness interpersonal effectiveness and distress tolerance are all part of my life now i m not perfect and i m always willing to put in the work but life is better than ever before i truly feel like my bpd is in recession i also recently got sober which helps a lot so this last february my wife and i separated this is primarily due to my unstable moods anger issues substance abuse and hyper sexuality i moved into my own place and it took months to stabilize and get into a healthy and productive routine my last appointment with my therapist i mentioned that i understood i was in a vulnerable situation and i was taking dating very cautiously being roughly 70 days sober not completely over my ex and prone to emotional dependency i need to really consider my actions and emotions i m in a vulnerable place where i could relapse in a few different ways well two days after that she texts me at 11 30 pm and starts flirting with me she s never texted me before and acknowledged how risky it was to do so she even mentioned the fact that i said i was vulnerable and stated she felt vulnerable as well i at first told her i wasn t available because i had gone on a date with a new girl and wanted to give that my full attention while i figured out where it was going also i m not attracted to this woman another day goes by and i can t fight the curiosity i started texting her and just soaked up the attention what felt sexually deviant asking her about why she likes me what she s into what she would do to me what she wants me to do to her here s the thing i have a history periods of being sexually involved with people who i m not attracted to because i like the attention i like being used and i like things that feel taboo i almost always end up feeling ashamed and disgusted by my behavior when this happens and this woman more than anyone knows all of that about me well two nights after she texted me for the first time i went over to her place to give her what she wanted she didn t pressure me to so we were both consenting but it doesn t feel good now i almost immediately realized i wasn t into what i was doing but i stayed and kept doing things until i got her off then i left looking back on it it feels a little predatory here s the person i ve been most honest with about my hyper sexual episodes and how they ve always made me feel bad and i end up getting baited into just that i m not going to report her at this point i should have better control over myself but i m disappointed in both of us i ve since asked her to refer me to a new therapist she did so happily and respectfully and the new one feels like a great fit there ya go edit i want to thank everyone for the overwhelming response to this post i have to admit i was honestly struggling with whether or not i should feel bad about this situation it s pretty clear now that what she did was wrong had the cards not been so stacked in her favor she s definitely not someone i would ve been intimate with so here s the update and i ll say at the beginning that many people are going to be less than satisfied i reached out to her and told her exactly how i feel about what happened how it was manipulative and i m left feeling used she seemed to be apologetic and understanding as to why i felt that way i say seemed because to be brutally honest i don t know if this is a one time fuck up or a calculated cruel person just doing her thing of course when you get called out on doing something wrong you say whatever it takes to deescalate the situation so who the fuck knows i want to preface this next part with my feelings of how to support people dealing with abuse trauma and the like i think it s important to make yourself available to listen offer support and support them in finding closure however they deem necessary i ve had friends who were assaulted and didn t report it and i tried to understand that it s their closure to find not mine she said i d be well within my rights to report this if i decided to do so i m not planning on reporting her i m not blaming myself for what happened but again it s not uncommon for me to get myself into situations i regret like this i ve expressed how i feel about it i m choosing to believe that she is sorry and remorseful choosing because again i ll never really know and i m moving on it s not fair to be taken advantage of but i also don t feel like it s fair for me to be the one who has to report this and take on that process go easy on me but this is where i m at with it who knows i may end up feeling differently about it in the future hell even as i write this i m thinking did she ever care about my well being she never contacting me outside of a meeting to check on me even after i d cry in a meeting and tell her i don t know what to do and i couldn t fix my life i couldn t control myself she never texted it was only when she wanted sex that she went there yeah idk that s where i m at sorry to let y all down thanks again for the validation and support,370,152,870.0085331

"I just want a test that tells me what‚Äôs wrong with me and how to fix it, is that too much to ask?",i m just feeling frustrated with mental health treatment i ve been seeing doctors and therapists for the past 2 years and i m not any better off i think i m actually worse i wish there was any easier way instead of an hour or so long intake describing symptoms for a diagnosis then someone making a guess as to which drug might work oh that didn t work lets take a another spin of the wheel ok how about this one meanwhile meet with a therapist and talk about stuff and of course lots of advice from friends family and society at large exercise eat this diet meditate practice gratitude i ve tried so many different things my head is spinning i just want someone to tell me why this is happening to me and make it stop ok thanks for reading just needed to get that off my chest hoping maybe someone out there can relate,373,57,1697.991508
"Mental illness isn‚Äôt a choice, we don‚Äôt wake up one day and say ‚ÄúHey you know what?! I want to start hearing voices in my head. That sounds like a great idea! Let‚Äôs throw in some anxiety and a dash of depression while we‚Äôre at it!‚Äù",living with a mother who has a mental illness caused me to have a lot of resentment and anger as a child it has also caused me to have my own issues with anxiety and depression my mom had her own business and was very successful when i was 8 we had a flood in our house that completely destroyed her business i didn t know it at the time but she started doing heavy drugs she would constantly pass out and not eat for days at 8 i was no longer a child but a parent i remember going into our kitchen to cook food so she would eat and seeing pipes and burnt spoons on the counter as a teenager she would trick me into thinking that we could practice driving so i could get my license when in reality she would be flagging people down the street asking if they had any drugs she could buy few years later she was put in a psychiatric hospital she had called the police telling them to stop following her and bugging her house she was arrested and placed in a psychiatric facility and diagnosed with schizophrenia she was later court ordered to stay in a half way house after her time was up she decided that she never needed help and was able to walk out freely without anyone stopping her anosognosia has serious consequences i ve watched my family members step away from her like the plague because they became so angry with her that she wouldn t admit that she needed help or believed that she was doing it on purpose for attention they convinced themselves that she would somehow snap out of it here s my main point in all of this if a person does not think that they need help they will not get treatment in coping with my own mental issues forcing anyone to do something they hate is far worse for our mental health instead of fighting it accept it for what it is stop putting these expectations on us that are unrealistic sometimes we don t need help in the way you think is best we don t need further rejection or guilt most times we just need support we need love,374,39,2295.267989
Was the way my mother touched and treated me growing up normal?,im 21 now i don t even know at this point i ve been thinking a lot about my childhood and now i m remembering lots of things this might just be jumbled because i m just typing as a go i remember since i was a child she would touch me between the legs a lot she d tickle me or pinch me there to tease me this has probably happened hundreds of times i don t think it really stopped until i was 18 or 19 maybe it wasn t under my clothing so i don t think it was sexual it was just weird she had a weird obsession with my underwear she would smell my used clothes in front of me a lot sometimes she would call me over and smell my underwear while i was wearing it if i told her no she would tell me that it was her job as a mother to do this and that all moms do this with their children she said it was her favorite smell this kept going into my teenage years we had this weird joke about me not wearing underwear so sometimes she d check she d touch my butt or my genital area to see if she could feel it beneath my pants other times she d also just pull back my pants and just look the last time i remember her doing this was when i was 20 she used to walk around the house completely naked but stopped after my dad got angry and told her it was inappropriate to do that in front of us when i was around 16 17 she would force me to sleep in the same bed as her while she was naked she would hold me against her body and her genitals would touch my skin when i told her i didnt like doing that she would get upset and told me that it was natural i got scared when she did this to me and after i told her that i was scared she would rape me she stopped i feel a lot of guilt for saying this around the same time i came out to her as a transgender man and still am a man today and she didn t react well sometimes she would lightly touch my chest and try to get me to appreciate my female body this is all i can remember at the moment i feel sick and scared when i interact with her sometimes and i don t know if it s really justified,370,124,292.0417739

How much do you believe that people's financial difficulties can affect their mental health?,i don t know if i m one of the few who believe this but by reading informing myself and experiencing it firsthand i believe they have a very important impact on our mental health and on our life in general here is just one of the many articles i found,368,104,1150.492723

"I actually can't stand the saying ""Happiness is a choice"".",i constantly see inspirational quotes about how happiness is a choice and it s frustrating to me hear me out yes of course it s a choice when life is going well for you because your baseline is already happy it s actually easy to choose happiness when you re already happy but when you are facing a hardship in life or you are feeling depressed you are not waking up to sunshine and rainbows and butterflies everyday choosing happiness might not be in the cards for you when you re struggling just to make it through the day and that might not seem fair especially when you see the people around you enjoying life and living so lightly but believe it or not the struggles you are faced with are fair because in the end they are a damn gift it may not feel like it now it feels horrible and heartbreaking and hopeless but slowly but surely each day will get better and you will get through it and become a stronger person and let me tell you when happiness is finally an option for you again you will choose it and feel it so deeply in your soul you will understand why you had to lose it in the first place and you will do everything you can to never let that feeling go,374,57,1520.873927

Why am I listening to a bunch of bullies talking about how much they care about mental health?!,our firm has this national wide event called mental illness awareness week being in this practice for so long i was fully aware of the fact that if anyone ever found out i was diagnosed with depression and had been medicated for 10 years attempted two unsuccessful suicides and still had mental breakdown from time to time during busy season i would be isolated by everyone and have no further career progression but i am seeing all these perfectly normal individuals talking about their experiences with mental illness mainly because of their family members what am i supposed to feel that our existence hindered their career progression and made their lives miserable i had enough guilty feeling because of my mom i can even recognize one of the guest speakers when i suffered from workplace bully and i talked to him he did not do anything many many times the work triggered my depression is because of workplace bully as the manager with the highest billable hours and highest billable clients i got paid significantly less than every other managers many times i wonder if it is because of my east asian heritage,369,44,1399.219158

Why does venting to friends feels selfish and manipulative? Is it wrong?,these days i have just been going through a lot and i feel so alone and sad i feel like there is no one i can talk to everytime i feel like maybe talking to my friends it just feels like i am being selfish and i also feel like they might not be able to know what to do so why should i just ruined the mood like that i so want to talk to someone but i hate feeling like i am using people or being an inconvenience to them i hate bringing sadness to others i have tried multiple times in the past going counselling but because of the limited time we are given since it s free it has never been enough,367,36,1486.554691
My ex saw my scars and she kissed them,to clarify the situation she is an ex because we want different things in life but we still care about each other and we are doing very good as friends she knew i cut myself and asked me to show her the cuts and after some mental preparation i did and she took my arm and caressed and kissed the cuts and scars after that and she gave me a kiss on the cheek and because i hadn t felt that nice for a long time i started crying and she made me promise to try and get better for my sake as a start i think that is difficult but she actually made me want to stop cutting because i now know that my actions can have consequences on her as well it may be a small start but it s a start baby steps,370,71,1570.072167
"After more than 2 years working on a relationship with a person suffering with mental illness, I can say I've reached a place where we both feel deeply happy and in love",i have a 2 year long relationship with someone diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder things have been very hard in the past but right now i feel really happy on my relationship and i do envision a long term future with this person i don t exactly know why i am writing this but since i feel like sharing a little of my story with the world i thought it might be useful to someone to read my statement about my experience and journey to where i am now things were really hard in the beginning my partner was very unstable and deeply depressed simple things like sleeping or eating were herculean tasks to him that demanded a lot huge anxiety was easily triggered that led to paranoid and intrusive thoughts specially at night sometimes it lasted a couple of days sometimes it lasted weeks or a month i really felt like on the more happy and stable days i had to take the best advantage out of it so that he felt like coming back from the pit hole was worth it i felt like every time we cycled back into a depressive episode he was further and further away from me i knew i couldn t really do much more than support him and maintain the bare minimum communication he allowed me to have with him but i just kept insisting and insisting because i thought that if i stopped doing so he would just detach completely from everything and everyone it was rough sometimes the emotional distance between us was so big that i thought i was in love with a man that would never love me i felt neglected emotionally a lot of the times because i was supporting everything i could but i couldn t really have that back because my partner was living in a survival mode when he became more willing to share our communication also improved he shared more with me and i learned how to help him better and also how to help myself to not take things too personally sometimes also therapy and medical treatment were of main importance for his progress of course there s no partner that can cure an illness it can make it less difficult for sure but only the right treatment can really make it better fast forward to nowadays my partner works a full time job with quite some responsibility he has plans for the future with me he s stable for the most part he keeps his medical and therapy appointments on check and he s happy i wouldn t be with anyone else but him i m more confident than i have ever been for the first time i feel someone truly sees me and values me we re both on our early 20s and starting our careers i hope we can move in together in the near future of course there are still bad times but i do think we are more prepared now to manage the hard times i love him deeply i m so so proud of him for overcoming so much and that he s no longer suicidal i am beyond happy he hang on long enough to embrace the person he s becoming and let himself love and be loved too there s no better feeling in the world than just laying on his chest listening to his heart beating at night before falling asleep i now it sounds very cheesy but it s really the truth for me it does feel like heaven if you re on a relationship going with a hard time understanding and dealing with your partner s mental health i don t mean with this that you should stay and that you should endure all of it because i know how brutal and lonely it can be mental illness is devastating for the ones suffering with it but also to others close to them on a relationship it can indeed became unhealthy for both parts to stay together so by no means i believe that the answer is always to stay i only want to say that sometimes it takes time and work but things do get better a lot better,366,28,1597.853406

I wish there was a magical pill to just not have life suck,life sucks it really sucks it s always sucked and it s going to continue to suck i have never been diagnosed with anything or have gotten any therapy i want to get therapy but it s hard to find when you re absolutely broke have no insurance and can t get any financial help from anyone or anything even if i start therapy life is still going to suck i ll still have a horrible past and i ll still be alone i wish i could just take a happy pill that made all my problems go away a magical pill to take my miserable unfulfilling boring hopeless life and morph it into something that actually mattered but that pill doesn t exist and i m nowhere near the finish line of this misery marathon that s made up my life what are you supposed to do when your so broken you can t even be helped i can t even do anything right now and the only thing i can do to help myself is just grin and bear it for eternity this is truly hell,367,113,1474.289517

Driving around for hours listening to Nine Inch Nails and getting pulled over by the military police has been an oddly enlightening experience.,i d even go so far as to say spiritual and i do not consider myself spiritual or religious anymore i was feeling like shit today borderline suicidal and since i m living with my parents for the time being i had to get out of the house to feel through my emotions in private and it was just the most compelling feeling of peace i ve experienced in a long time something about the music throbbing while i drove through a really heavy fog only car on the road with the streetlights glowing pretty colors through the mist just got my thoughts flowing freely again i won t jump the gun and say i m cured but i did just resist some self destructive habits once i got home and i m now doing the coursework that i ve been putting off at risk of failing out of school because i just didn t have the energy for it so even if i wake up next week and i m worse off and i feel silly for being optimistic at least i got a precious window of peace and lucidity that helped me to at least pass the semester oh and getting pulled over so i was so absorbed with my thoughts i was doing the drive on autopilot thing see and react to things like red lights and sudden movements but not really think about where i m going i was just navigating by instinct and i ended up going too far on a road and heading for the military base just outside town turns out military cops don t really like it when you suddenly show up to their gates in the middle of the night with a car full of mysterious boxes haven t fully unpacked yet then suddenly freak out turn around drive on the wrong side of the road for a minute then correct yourself and try to leave thinking nobody saw you being silly and stupid anyway the guy that immediately pulled me over was just a really really genuine human he asked me how my night was going and i just explained the whole thing the need to get out and clear my head the reason i was too distracted to see the big ass signs about it being a military base that s also due to the fog it was incredibly thick in my defense sounded like an absolute nervous wreck and he listened and he was really empathetic just letting me off with a warning the funny thing is i spent a while beating myself up thinking man this guy must think i m some huge kind of stupid weak kid he s a responsible ass adult working a job in public safety and here he is having to chase down a stupid kid with a panic issue all because i can t properly process my feelings but i considered it for a bit and i realized that this random cop who doesn t owe me anything who s shift i rudely interrupted saw me in one of my worst states and still had it in him to treat me kindly and listen to me actually listen to what i was going through and i realized that i haven t been doing that for myself guys see i need to treat myself with the same empathy and sincerity that this cop treated me with i need to listen to myself and forgive myself even especially when i m in my worst states because the only way to leave those states is with love and support and 90 of the time when i m not lucky enough to have this cop around i need to provide that love and support for myself i think for the first time in a long time i can cut the cynicism for one little moment and tell myself it s gonna be okay and actually mean it,362,21,1758.478767
I am one month clean from self harm!,the lady at trader joes was more proud of me than my own father,362,31,1201.173026
"""Your child, your rules"" is single-handedly the most stupid saying I have ever heard",now i am speaking from experience when i say that this statement does wayyyyyy more harm than it ever did good my mother is an abusive pos father was even worse before he was divorced routinely i would go to over to videos on subreddits and just watch some posts there i recently saw a post about parenting and people in the comments all had the same general consensus that your child your rules x200b x200b problem is no one really gets all the possible ways that this could be applied sure it is usually used for logical stuff like what religion the child is associated with or maybe whether the child is a vegetarian or a meat eater but have you thought this saying through you re saying that it is this person s child and that they should be able to make the rules you are putting this person on one of the most dangerous power trips ever now what would you do if you found out this person over underfeeds their child what if they feed the child too much junk or strictly healthy foods without letting them have any junk food what would you do if whenever the child speaks up they shut them down and go on a tangent before mentioning i m your parent now do you see where i m coming from look that was pretty much my story so i hope you really listen to what i m saying i m 15 years old and i could tell you that shit is damaging i don t need anyone going through something similar because people keep using this idiotic statement and yes i know this sounds like a giant hyperbole but it really isn t think about it if you re living with the mentality that this is my child i set the rules for them and no one else you are most likely going to turn out as an abusive narcissistic parent it s a terrible lesson to be spreading on these subreddits and are most of the time not even warranted being a parent means nothing more than you contributed to the birth and growth of this child and you are not at all entitled to jack shit if you betray that initial trust respect is a two way street regardless of who you are,355,49,1546.966232

You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself?,i remember feeling pretty smart when i was a kid maybe that s just how all kids feel but that s what i remember getting better grades than most other kids during my teenage years i didn t work very hard and still got good grades i even got accepted into a school that only took on students that got good grades that s when things started to change everyone seemed so much smarter than me and it was really scary i went from feeling like one of the smartest guys in the room to the dumbest and i d let myself know just how dumb i was beating myself up soon i wasn t just stupid i was boring then i was ugly and weak and pathetic in the eyes of everyone i felt like i was getting dumber a brain fog had permeated my mind i couldn t think as fast my grades slipped as i worked even less and started playing video games more gaming takes up your attention and the thoughts more or less stop i still managed to get into a decent university but i was ashamed of my accomplishment because all my classmates were moving on to much more prestigious ones i lasted two and a half years at uni before the suicidal thoughts started to become a real plan scared friendless and far from home i decided not to go through with it one night the worst night of my life instead i called my mom late that night and early the next morning i was on a train home since then i ve been living with my mom i work as a waiter and the job sees a high staff turnover with a majority of people working there being students trying to earn some money in between their studies i can feel them judging me when i tell them that it s all i do i m not doing this part time while i chase my dreams i don t have anything else going on i m a 25yo man living with his mom and working a minimum wage job i got help of course talking to some professionals and taking pills but the thoughts never really left i know i m not supposed to indulge them my therapist told me you wouldn t say those things to your best friend so why would you say them to yourself i would reply that my best friend isn t trying to sabotage and fuck up my life but i was never trying to do that and yet i felt like i deserved to hear the the things i was telling myself and deserved the life i now had because of how stupid and pathetic i was recently after doing something stupid but totally forgivable and human i googled is it possible to get dumber the first result was the question is it psychologically possible to get dumber on quora one of the answers by norma pellett my experience tells me yes i know a woman who was articulate and educated i moved away and saw her again after ten years she had no opinions of her own and couldn t articulate a decent sentence i asked other friends if she had been ill or in an accident no she hadn t then i heard her husband talking to her he called her stupid and told her what she was doing was idiotic he berated her for several more minutes she was so cowed by this abuse that she bought into his assessment of her intelligence she became what he expected her to be i was too young and unsure of myself to call him on it or even to try to find a way to help her i am ashamed that i didn t do anything i m not even sure that thirty years ago people really thought of emotional abuse as abuse there were no bruises or broken bones but this was much worse don t spend any time with someone who puts you down not even if they say just kidding or can t you take a joke months and years of this humor can destroy anyone abuse is a terrible thing and i don t want to diminish it or its victims but i couldn t help but compare the husband to the voice in my head the abuse i put myself through i imagine having another person tell you those things is a thousand times worse i have always thought that a smart person was smart no matter what that they may not believe it and people might tell them otherwise but they were unchangeably smart maybe it s obvious to everyone else but it never occurred to me that people could become the person they were told they are that their personality could be moulded what my therapist should have told me is you wouldn t emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself thinking of it that way it s hard to feel like i deserve it there is not a person in the world that i believe deserves abuse so how to stop it s important not to try telling yourself the opposite of the things you usually tell yourself i m not going to look in the mirror every day and tell myself i m smart confident handsome etc that just feels inauthentic and quite silly what you have to do instead is learn to recognise the thoughts and externalize them think of them as not your own but rather your anxiety s or your depression s your illness is your own personal abuser then the next step will be to stop believing the thoughts by not giving them your attention don t think the opposite or try to argue with them e g i m not ugly i m beautiful instead try to refocus on whatever it is you were doing this is hard but can get easier with practice mindfulness meditations help you can even try talking back to the thoughts as though you aren t taking them seriously thanks anxiety tell me that again c mon that s what you always say ha that s a good one i was hoping you were going to show up i feel so far behind everyone else but i m going to really try getting better this time,360,22,2078.479519
I think people who make jokes/say that people need to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or ‚Äúgrow a pair‚Äù or ‚Äúbe a man‚Äù are part of the problem.,my friend tried to commit suicide last night i watched him drive away in his car drunk and he went on the highway motorway saying he didn t care if he died tried to stop him but couldn t that s not the issue though i had no idea he was suicidal his family had no idea he was suicidal his friends had no idea he d kept his mouth shut and let these feelings fester the conversation about male mental health is nowhere near what it needs to be it is heading in the right direction sure but at the moment it only seems to be a big deal when someone is on the brink of suicide or having severe depression there is no emphasis on normal day to day life people telling young boys to man up if they are upset saying be a man this is vile behaviour and forces boys to stuff down their feelings and deal with it through anger since they feel they can t talk it through even saying it to girls shows them that this is how they should act and that boys should act differently when it comes to feelings in the us four times as many suicides are by males 9 have daily anxiety or depression of those 9 only a quarter found help for it according to the national health survey 2010 13 source in the uk 76 of suicides are carried out by males and 12 5 men are affected by depression of the people that seek help through therapy only 36 are men then the most shocking stat from the uk of all the things that kill men under 45 getting hit by a car murder heart attacks etc the leading cause of death is suicide i am an under 45 male in the uk and to know that the most likely way for me to die statistically is for me to kill myself is shocking and scary only 15 of men report they would take time off work to focus on mental health 34 would feel embarrassed or ashamed to do so for a mental health issue compared to the 15 feeling ashamed for a physical injury 38 would feel that their employer would look down on them for taking time off for a mental health issue compared to the 26 for a physical source even among my friends this sort of man up talk happens where if a guy gets upset over something deemed trivial he gets told to stop being a girl i personally am quite sensitive when i get super angry i tend to tear up i hate it because it sometimes weakens my argument but it s just how i am when i get angry i tear up it s not a sad cry i m just angry i had an argument with a close female friend and she said i m only joking so stop crying and grow a pair man up that says my feelings aren t allowed because i m male because apparently i m not supposed to feel that way i should be calm and collected at all times but all that does is make my squash my feelings away and deal with them some other way that other way can turn into depression and eventually suicide we need to change the mental health conversation so that it s not a conversation about men on the brink of suicide i m aware that it isn t only aimed there but at the moment to me it feels like not enough is focused on males feeling like they can talk their problems through with people,358,59,2082.365781
Do y‚Äôall mentally ill isolated people sometimes just want someone to hug you and give you a compliment?,when i haven t seen anyone in a few days or i miss my old friends sometimes i break down and the only thing i want is a hug and for someone to tell me i m worth something remind me what i m good at why i belong here with them which i m not i m alone again edit jeez this blew up thank you everyone i want you all to know that i care about each and every single one of you please feel free to pm me we can talk about absolutely anything from the mundane to the existential and supernatural all of you are worth something and all of you deserve a big old hug from op himself,362,48,2169.405249

Self care few tips.,1 eat well after dealing with fair share of mental health issues i have totally seen how food affects my mood 2 sleep a minimum of 7 hours a day 3 drink water 2 3 liters 4 don t binge watch stuff like 3 hours maximum 5 exercise it could just be walk like 20 30 minutes 6 think about your past for like few minutes in a day 7 go out and socialize no worries if you have no friends just go out alone for a walk talk to somebody in a day even if it s strangers 8 you are stronger than you give yourself credit,361,36,2152.283212
"Does anyone else feel like they downplay how bad they're feeling to therapists, doctors etc?",i guess i m scared to actually say how bad i ve gotten but that ends up making things worse because i feel like nobody actually takes me seriously when i say i m not doing too well i instinctively try to lighten up conversations with humour which gives the impression that i m doing fine i ve even had doctors and psychologists ask me if i think i m suicidal and when i hinted towards yes i couldn t bring myself to actually say it they didn t even act like it was serious i honestly don t know what i want and i don t know if it s best to just stay quiet and keep acting like i m okay,352,54,2301.896371

Religion used to mess with my mental health SO MUCH,there is just so much guilt guilt for not praying guilt for not fasting guilt for feeling sexually attracted to someone guilt for masturbating guilt for eating certain foods guilt for dressing a certain way guilt for things that are in no way hurting another human being guilt for everything i left religion some 6 or 7 years ago and i m not gonna pretend my mental health is perfect right now but letting it go has helped me let go of so much unnecessary guilt i still get anxious and jittery for no reason and i still have days where i don t really feel like getting out of bed but at least i don t go into a downward spiral and make things worse for myself by also shaming myself for missing prayers by not getting out of bed i m proud of myself for letting go of something that was only hurting my mental health,355,93,1431.696834
I did something today that I haven't done since 2019,i folded my laundry just about one year ago my ocd caused me to suffer another complete mental and emotional breakdown collapse culminating in an unsuccessful suicide attempt being in such an unstable state is one thing but then being quarantined and unemployed made things dark horrific really i spent every waking and sleeping moment in bed trying to escape the confines of my own mind i would go a week without showering wearing the same sweats and t shirt every day i very nearly attempted suicide again before the day i broke i had emptied my dresser and closet and did a giant wash of almost every item of everyday wear i owned clothes for all seasons and for the next year they lay in assorted baskets strewn across the laundry room untouched and unexplored i ve started coming around to stability and normality over the past month and today decided to finally take a step out of the darkness and fold my god damn laundry and it feels amazing i don t mean to sound braggy or anything i guess i just wanna say that things can better and the small victories can be really powerful and uplifting the dark times seem eternal but with hard work therapy meds faith support family and friends whatever aids your mental health journey things can get better even in times such as these wishing the community the very best for the holiday season and all the times to come i love and believe in you all,349,40,1545.039369

CONFESSION: Hearing successful people claim to have mental illness makes me insecure.,i know it s not good but when i hear someone who is kicking ass or very well adjusted in life claim they suffer from mental illness too all i hear is i have it just as bad as you do with mental health only i m managing to completely crush it in life hahaha wooooo granted i know this isn t what s literally being said but ideas like this make me very insecure about my position in the hierarchy of life i myself have have depression anxiety and aspergers and i have fought and struggled for only a small bit of success in this life,352,78,1810.339763

Let‚Äôs all discuss toxic positivity,what is the one thing that you have been told that screams toxic positivity and what situation were you in my example would be when i had a heavy workload at my job and instead of getting helped out i got told instead you just got to think positive i told the individual just words encouragement is not gonna help me catch up on my work this is a manual labor job that i was at that s one example of my toxic positivity experience,346,223,1203.954473
Whenever I get closer with somebody I open up to then. Then I freak out and vulnerable because I feel like I told them too much and slowly start to avoid them. What do I do?,i don t mean to do this and feel like an awful friend whenever i start drifting away from people but i get so scared whenever i feel like i tell people too much in case they use that information negatively it s all in my mind but it s either open up a little as i get closer which is normal or continue to treat the person like a stranger i feel like a useless person because i m afraid of losing friendships i almost never text first i hide from social interaction and now with being home all the time i m afraid that when i can go out again i ll be worse,350,41,1564.819057
I wish people understood or cared about the psychological damage of small penis shaming.,growing up a boy society repeatedly makes sure you understand a few things about being a man on for those things is that a man is supposed to be big both in height but especially in penis size you see that any man who s small is to be treated with ridicule and scorn and you see that men with big penis are treated with admiration and praise it s been 7 years since mine was referred to as a pencil dick by a woman not to my face but to a friend who thought i should know i don t wanna go into the personal depression spiral i went through being convinced i was sexually unlovable but i will say it s not 7 years since and i m still deathly afraid of getting naked with a woman i just don t feel safe i know the world will never change no matter what forms of body shaming become publicly wrong to do small penis shaming will remain a good popular and acceptable form if body shaming so my struggle is maintaining some form of self worth when i m constantly reminded how worthless and inadequate having a small penis makes a man when i hear people laughing at small penis jokes as if it really does make us deserving of ridicule,346,190,564.5402602

My Parents Punished me for Having PTSD,i had been sexually abused by my grandfather for 3 4 years literally all of my early childhood i do not have a single memory before him abusing me my parents found out after constantly punishing me for masturbating in my room wetting the bed having outbursts etc there was legal action taken i was in counseling for the bare minimum time i had horrible nightmares night terrors i sleptwalked my parents literally punished me for getting out of bed and waking my mom who was a stay at home mom with all of her kids being in school for 8 hours out of the day up because i had nightmares that made me feel terrified paralyzed and unable to go back to sleep on one specific occasion i remember being in the 3rd or 4th grade only 1 2 years after the abuse had ended and waking my mom up because i had a nightmare about dolls trying to kill me my parents were so mad that my dad made me sleep with the light on in an attempt to make it where i couldn t sleep when i did fall asleep that night he came in and intentionally woke me up telling me i didn t deserve to be asleep i was going to learn a lesson about waking my mom up and that he hoped i didn t sleep all night i had school the next morning on top of all of that they made me stay home from a party that everyone else got to go to my mom stayed home with me when they got back my sister had brought me candy he said i wasn t allowed to have it he also made a point of saying how everyone asked where i was and he told everyone why i couldn t be there and he made me feel guilty for my mom not being able to go and having to stay home i confronted my mom about it today i m 24 and she just immediately started saying the typical oh yeah we get it we re terrible parents your childhood was terrible she then kept saying i never told them i was having nightmares even though i remember always telling them about my nightmares and the only time i didn t get punished was the night i had a nightmare about someone shooting my family because that was deemed realistic enough to be afraid i told her all i wanted her to do was apologize and she full out said she will never apologize and to leave her alone i got frustrated and sarcastically asked if they were never told i would have ptsd after being abused my entire childhood she said no so i asked if they seriously didn t have enough common sense to think maybe their child was traumatized and she said no my parents were so focused on making me normal that they traumatized me worse than that abuse ever did and they won t even acknowledge that they did anything wrong,352,36,1580.316487
The fact that not everyone recovers from mental illness makes feel so bad,i ve been through some tough stuff for the last 2 years and now i know how awful mental illness can be i know that some people have it worse than me and i m not that optimistic guy who says time heals all wounds i know some people can t recover hell maybe i won t recover although i feel signs of progress from time to time anyway it s so awful for me to think that some people must deal with this stuff for the rest of their lives it almost feels unfair if i ever get to recover from my own mental illness,352,63,1815.341892

"people only care about mental illnesses that are cute, quiet, and make it easy to pity you. do you agree?",when my only diagnosis was depression and anxiety i was easily pitied and white knighted either by boys who thought being suicidal and helpless was sexy or with half assed attempts from mental health workers volunteers well my bpd symptoms got worse instead of sulking when i am feeling self doubt or low self esteem i immediately project and lash out this comes from a place of extreme pain and years of trauma but because it is a stark contrast to the inwardness of depression i rarely get the same attitude i did when i didn t mention bpd symptoms i see it constantly no regard for anger as a mental health symptom in support communities pointing fingers and calling the aggressive psychopathic etc people will advocate when you re all cute and quiet and tiny and not making any noise once your mental illness becomes external and your pain manifests into outbursts and aggression it s completely dismissed and the person is disregarded and abandoned this is why i am so afraid of having bpd but that s beside the point i was wondering if you guys had any experience with this phenomenon,346,57,1322.123107

is my dad slapping my ass sexual assault,for context im 16 years old my dad started playfully slapping my ass a while ago and at first it was just a silly joke kind of thing between us but then i started getting uncomfortable because he would also say stuff like my ass was too small while touching it he said that guys liked girls with big butts and that i need to put on some weight i kindly asked him to stop slapping my ass shortly after that and he got so butthurt he said that he just wanted us to be close and that it was sad how he couldn t even joke with his own daughter and didn t stop i made it clear to him that i didn t like it whenever he layed his hands on my ass and my mom would usually be there too but said nothing one day i started crying after he did it again and that made him stop now whenever i bring it up and be like hey dad that wasn t very nice of you he starts gaslighting me and says that thats not what happened and that i m making it up this kinda turned into a vent thing lol im safe now but i just want to know if that counts as sexual assault edit please stop telling me to report him he didn t molest me yes it might have escalated but it did not i m safe now i love my dad and seeing people call him a pedo doesn t really help,345,82,1242.268119

"Am I the only one who enjoys nothing and views life as an empty, pointless path towards death anyways?",ever since my other parent ended up dying i ve turned into a toxically pessimistic piece of shit to the point the discussion of my views has broken friendships life feels like an empty walk through a barren valley to death feels like there s absolutely nothing to work towards nobody to impress nobody to be proud of me nobody to be happy or upset of who i turned into it s just me hoping to find my own meaning in life although there is none absolutely nothing at all can bring a smile to my face besides driving so fast and dumb i realize i almost died then almost died again and again it goes so so much deeper much more than i would ever tell reddit or a psychiatrist but leaving it as simple as this please tell me i m not alone i can t be the only one who feels like their better meaning would be to just die is there a way to break free or is this who i m destined to be for the next 70 years of my life,343,72,1437.393651
A Letter To Those Wanting To Understand Their Loved Ones With Mental Illness,a letter to those wanting to understand their loved ones with mental illness if you are reading this as one of many who doesn t understand what it s like to deal with mental illness i am very happy you don t experience firsthand what i and so many others have to experience on a daily basis because i would not wish this pain on my worst enemy i am so happy you don t have to experience feeling that no one in your life truly loves or cares about you despite them reassuring you that they do on almost a daily basis i am so happy you haven t had to answer any of the further questions that follow do you feel anxious or depressed when visiting the doctor s office i am so happy you have never thought the world is better without you in it if you have never had to leave a party because of a sudden wave of anxiety or sadness i really hope it stays that way if you are able to get out of bed without feeling nauseous with anxiety or the weight of depression appreciate it every single day don t ever take it for granted don t let a day go by without appreciating how beautiful life is and can be because many of us myself included aren t always able to see that beauty no matter how hard we try while mental illness is something that is so wrongfully romanticized in the movies it is very ugly in real life mental illness is not quirky or poetic like society makes it seem on social media being mentally ill isn t aesthetic worthy mascara filled tears with sad music in the background mental illness is barely being able to keep up basic personal hygiene because it feels almost physically impossible to get out of bed mental illness makes the world seem pointless so when a loved one approaches you seeking comfort or a listening ear please don t automatically assume it is an annoying cry for attention because i promise you that assumption is our worst fear the last thing we wish for is to be a burden on the ones we love isn t it ironic that even when we are struggling our first thought is to not make our loved ones uncomfortable and when we cancel plans or fail to stay around the entirety of a social outing don t take it personally trust me we already beat ourselves up for it enough already because we finally put ourselves first for once even though that is what we should ve been doing all along when we isolate ourselves from you and push you away don t think it is us being rude we are just trying to do what we can to feel like we aren t dragging you down with us please do not blame us for the cards we got dealt we deal with them the best we are able to even if it means pushing loved ones away to avoid getting hurt most of all see mental illness as you would any broken bone or any physical sickness it hurts just as bad and is equally out of our control so while we don t wish you would first handedly understand we want you to be patient and understand the best you are able to we are fighting an invisible illness that we aren t always sure we can beat however even with this ongoing battle to stay afloat in our own minds filled with endless thoughts not every single day is a bad one in fact we go through periods of time where everything feels alright again for a while so when those good days finally come around we appreciate it and never take it for granted because to those who struggle with mental illness it is a privilege to feel the true happiness that everyone deserves to feel every day sincerely the mentally ill,341,34,1567.580712

My 9-year-old is madly obsessed with me. Any advice?,x200b at first it seemed very cute and sweet like a crush sort of thing through this past few years it has been escalating to a point where it is creepy and i fear for her mental health and future safety i m telling this story as a way of trying to get some opinions let s call her cindy she is a daughter of a cousin of mine who i am not that close to but we still get along pretty well i m going to share some anecdotes so you all can see what i mean we come from a family where reunions and parties are common and happen at least once a month so we all see each other frequently cindy always wants to be around me she wants me to play with her and hold her every minute of every single reunion whenever i dare to hug say hi or even acknowledge any other member of the family especially when it comes to younger females of the family she would get upset and throw a tantrum running away onto the streets whenever the family starts dancing outside which is pretty often lol cindy makes me pick her up and dance with her i can only dance with her no other female is allowed near me i can t even put her down to go the bathroom or have a drink and whenever i did put her down well temper tantrum time she once smacked her youngest sister mia 2 year old so hard it almost knocked her out just because she was walking around the house spotted me smiled and wanted to get close to say hi anytime another female of the family would bring me something to eat or drink she would make me give it back or throw it away so she could go and bring me whatever i had just been given one time i did not show up to one of those reunions because some other plan that sounded more fun came around dick move i know cindy asked everyone a thousand times where i was and why i wasn t showing up eventually they got tired of her and decided to call me i explained that i was hanging out with some friends when they told her about this she got furious grabbed a stone and threw it at the nearest car breaking one of the windows she then locked herself up inside one of the rooms 3 or 4 times a week cindy s mom would call me telling me cindy wanted me to come over so i could help her with her homework sometimes her other sister 8 year old would ask for my help too causing cindy to flip out throw things at her and call her names whenever i refused the invitation to help cindy with her hw she would start ripping her notebooks and textbooks or pouring water on them she then started to force her parents to bring her to my place every other day even if it was for a short visit this one time they left her with me because they needed someone to watch her to do some errands cindy was in my room and i left for a couple of minutes to get her some snacks when i came back i found her going thru my clothes she started crying and said she wanted to steal one of my t shirts so she could remember me with it i thought it was kind weird but cute in a way i told her she could have one of her choosing each time she came over after that she demanded a new shirt to take i told her i couldn t give her anymore shirts because i don t have many which is true every time she would come we would have the exact same conversation until without me noticing she took pretty much all my shirts and stuffed them inside her backpack her mother had to come back the next day and give them back i used to play along and not say much to her or her mother because like i said i thought it just was a crush or just a little girl overly attached to an older family member it escalated gradually to a point which i didn t know what to do and besides i m really not into confrontation so i didn t want to cause any trouble last time i saw cindy was this past weekend another family reunion but this time i brought my new girlfriend with me she was my best friend for 6 years but i escaped the friendzone haha cindy was using crutches because she had gotten injured doing something or other while at school so she couldn t follow me around like she usually does obviously she got furious when she met my girlfriend but she didn t say much she sat right between us and didn t let us kiss hug or dance laura my gf went to grab a drink for both of us and immediately cindy started moving around so she was occupying the rest of the sofa when laura came back she refused to move and let her sit i lost my patience even when i lose my patience i m still pretty chill and told her that she was being mean to my gf and that meant she was also being mean to me i also told her we me and laura would have to leave if she kept it up cindy lost it she started screaming and kicking she called laura every name in the book and finished by saying that if we continued being together she would shoot us both with his father s gun turns out my cousin is not very bright and it took her this long to realize something might be wrong with her daughter my cousin pulled me aside and i told her everything everything i just told you and a lot more i advised her to seek help for cindy and told her it was best if i stayed away for a while im really worried about cindy and her wellbeing so please if anyone has gone thru something similar or if some of you understand what is going on and what can i do to help i would gladly listen thank you ps english is not my first language so sorry if some of the writing is gibberish,341,68,2044.673119
Feeling weird about some stuff my mom did to me and I just want answers.,so recently i was thinking about some things my mom has done while i was younger i m 17f now she would make me shower with her from 10 13 even though i was showering by myself during this time and she would wash my private parts with her hands not a wash cloth i felt weird about it but didn t say anything i would also lay down in the bed with her and she would start touching my inner thighs but nothing further also she would make me and my brothers rub her feet but she would make weird moaning noises and said that she had a foot fetish she also made a weird joke about how she would show me what it s like to get molested and tried taking my clothes off jokingly i remember being very uncomfortable when i was around 14 i told her that i had a boyfriend and she slammed me on the ground and made me tell her information about him and would not let me go also last month i was dealing with issues with constipation and she bought me this laxative device that you have to stick in your butt to do i have trauma from that era specifically because i was raped in july and she knows that she even knows that specific area is just a source of trauma but she made me take off my pants and kept insisting that she put it in her for me i kept saying no and that i would do it myself but she kept pushing me i literally was screaming no and she said that my stepdad does it for her all the time eventually i started crying and having ptsd flashbacks so she eventually backed off and apologized i don t know what to make of any of this my stepdad hasn t done anything weird but he did make a weird comment about my boobs being out when i was wearing a shirt i just want help and someone s thoughts,344,69,488.2138135

Is it just me or does life just feel like shit,honestly lately life has just felt well lifeless people are angry at each other from all over the globe whether if it s because of politics the pandemic race cops etc it just feels like everywhere people are just angry if they aren t angry then they are most likely depressed given the state of the world and what s been going on when you think of all those things together it really makes you feel like life has been shit and still is the folks on the news always seem like they are either angry at something or have something negative to talk about the people around me are uneasy with what s been going on jobs have been hard to come by when taking the pandemic into consideration if you don t want to work with other people because you are scared of the virus that s a huge chunk of jobs you can t get even if you get a job it s been tough trying to get a place to live comfortably the folks i know that have a place either work 90 of their week have two jobs or are unable to treat themselves because they can t afford to the most frustrating about all this is the lack of attention mental health has been getting at least on a national level all you hear is cases and deaths with very few articles mentioning mental health when you do they are actually talking about people who have covid or have had covid are experiencing depression like you can t have mental health issues without covid what kind of nonsense is that vaccines came out which you would think is something we should be hopeful for the news tries to scare people with hesitancy may stop us from going back to normal anyways that s all i have to say i do really hope it gets better but lately the longer the pandemic drags on i feel it s just going to make people worse and worse both mentally and physically,338,33,1413.408258
I'm surprised at how many mental health professionals don't know how to deal with mentally ill people,i ve been in a lot of mental hospitals and i ve seen a lot of sick people and the thing i m always so surprised at is how incompetent the staff is most are nice and well meaning people but absolutely clueless and often shocked when people have problems in there i remembered once a group of ladies were sitting with some of the staff and chatting about stuff and another patient was crying hard and obviously having a problem the staff just pretended to not see what was happening and kept chatting with the old ladies any kind of therapy was aimed at the lowest common denominator and that s understand but also useless it was maybe playing word games or reading the safety rules nothing helpful where do sick people go when they re too sick for the psych ward,343,74,1084.744693
Has anyone else noticed an increase in everyone's general anxiety in the last 3 decades?,i may just be talking out my ass but these days the average person seems much more anxious than they did back in the 90s i was watching old episodes of the red green show and idk what it was but they just seemed less anxious so many young people i talk to seem to have some form of social anxiety i feel it in myself as well this combination of over thinking and almost feeling like i should be happier than i am when watching anything from the 90s its not that everyone is overjoyed theyre just comfortable you can tell they arent over analyzing the situation theres no fear in their eyes just a steadiness and easiness blame what you like poor economy the internet i just wonder if im the only one who kinda sees it,343,59,1441.039265

What are y‚Äôall‚Äôs telltale signs that you‚Äôre in a depressive episode?,sometimes the signs can be subtle but i feel like a lot of people have one big thing that clues them into the fact they are definitely in a depressive episode for me i think it s probably not caring enough to even have 2 full meals in a day and keeping the light off for almost the entire day without opening my blinds i feel like sharing these can also help other depressed people maybe realize what their signs are and help them deal with it as best they can once they recognize the signs edit wow this is probably my most popular post i m glad people felt comfortable enough to share their experiences,338,255,362.0124552

Just another rape story,hello trapped in quarantine here and nobody to talk to so i ve chosen to write it out i 24f was raped by my own cousin for over a year when i was 14 years old story started with force him moving my hand forcing my head down holding me down locking me in cars etc same things that are pretty common with those raped by family members what i want to talk about is the aftermath what nobody really realizes my virginity wasn t lost the same way as my friends growing up i felt my body was meant to be used because that s all he told me i was good for so i believed him after having that happen to you for that long you begin to go numb it starts out with fighting then when you realize there isn t anything you can do after fighting screaming and clawing you way out for months you just give in and want to get it over with i don t feel like my body is mine i don t have a connection with sex i hear stories of people having sexual partners because they are in love or want to share that with their partners but i have always viewed sex as my duty it was my job to make men feel nice i never had a right to say no still feel like i don t i don t have connections with people every friend i push away because i don t fit in with them i m disconnected from what your typical 24 year old would want to do drink party yoga etc my focus for the time i ve grown up is to just make sure it doesn t happen again survivor mentality if you will i m not saying all this to feel sorry for myself it happens to a lot of people but what happened to me made me feel like a outcast i can t share losing my virginity stories because it wasn t funny or cute i can t stay in relationships with well anyone because i don t trust people because if family can hurt me in that way what s to stop others i don t talk to friends don t have any i ve lost a lot of my family due to what happened and the family i haven t lost like my mom dad and brother i don t talk to them anymore because they don t understand why i ve changed so much from the happy go lucky pretty teenage girl to the cold hearted one i am today nobody can help you but yourself i ve been told over and over again to just get over it but here we are 10 years later and i m over what happened to me it doesn t haunt me like it use to but that doesn t mean it didn t permanently change me my ability to form relationships my mentality my hobbies my happiness or my thought processes all have been changed because of one person 10 years ago so for those that have been raped you don t have to just get over it you don t have to just bury it but you can build because of it i m a strong person because of it just isolated so if you guys have any questions like how to help those that have been through it i will try to answer to the best of my abilities as another survivor thanks for reading edit woke up this morning and saw the post get so much love thank you guys for sharing this i hope it helps those that have been told over and over that it gets better to see from someone that has been through it it really does get better,331,58,1721.164018

"[Personal victory] For the first time ever, I was able to calm myself down after a panic attack, instead of going crazy in my own head",my so went out of town last night to go out with the guys i generally try not to bother him when he s out doing that because that s his time to do what he wants he has not come yet which is fine by me however the one message i sent him asking is there plans we made for this weekend that i forgot about he has yet to respond to it s been six hours since he was last active according to facebook messenger my panic attack started when i had this insane thought was he out all night boozing around getting frisky messing with other women my heart started racing my mind was running wild i started to breathe heavier and heavier i was in this state for about 30 minutes trying to remain calm finally i took a deep breath and thought to myself if he didn t cheat on me i m worked up for no reason if he did cheat i will deal with him later there was nothing i could do at that point in time because he either did or didn t do anything but getting worked up about it now literally does nothing but make me miserable i view this the calming myself down part as a personal victory i ve never been good at handling panic attacks well when i m by myself so i am kind of proud of myself,336,16,2167.980476

I Worry About This Sub,day after day night after night i scroll through my feed to catch up quick and i see so many posts on this sub mostly genuine people looking for encouragement empathy or just to know they re not alone but looking for that something that one thing that s gonna turn their struggle around sometimes a particular post will catch my eye and i ll interact but for the most part i watch time after time as people mostly young people reach out for somebody s hand and no one is there to respond i don t view this as any one person or group of people s fault i just think the sheer numbers of those looking for real help overwhelm the number of people qualified and or willing enough to provide it by such a large margin that a lot of the sub continually consists of largely ignored cries for help i wonder what impact this has on the greater good that all of us try to do for ourselves or other people when it comes to providing mental health care referrals and advice i wonder if there s a way it could be done better by all of us involved not only with our mental health for one reason or another but with our specific involvement in the sub i worry about all of our brothers and sisters out there who are in a position where this reddit sub is all they feel they have don t have any answers would love to hear fresh ideas from anyone and everyone involved,332,67,1318.970684
This sub seems to do little more than be a place to vent,don t get me wrong i think it does result in encouragement positive convos every once in a while but a lot of the time it s people who are really hurting that post then get either no response or a couple brief ones which makes sense given that we re all hurting can t really make the space for supporting others but surely it hurts when you pour your heart into a post get a single upvote no comments you feel i have no suggestions on improving this but just wanted to address it even if your post does not get a lot of engagement please do not take it as another sign that nobody cares people do care we just all are struggling too much to perhaps help like we could,334,69,1554.635511
'Everybody loves Raymond' has saved my life.,here in the uk every morning there is a raymond double bill and a frasier double bill i had a psychotic break in a manic episode two months ago and plunged into a deep depression and have spent every day in a blanket fort staring at the tv but every morning i have laughed at least once i laughed a lot this morning as long as i can laugh i can survive,337,45,1561.504666
My depression took my personality,during my f 20 teenage years i dealt with depression at some point during that it became all i was as many people know depression can make you loose interest in things that previously interested you i lost all my hobbies and a big chuck of my personality i was a shell i ve since overcome that part of my life and am left with this same shell i dont particularly have anything that makes me me anymore i don t have the patience strength to really finish anything i start eg artwork or writing and when i don t finish it it brings me down more essentialy i don t have a personality i think i m very boring and have crippling social skills i don t know how i would go about trying to fix this my lack of social skills due to isolating myself through arguably the most important part of my life development wise has also resulted in me loosing all my friends and unable to reconcile or make new ones i figure i can t be the only one going through this or something similar and wonder why this big part of this mental illness isn t really talked about edit to add further context my depression was a big part of who i was as it had such an effect on my life so without it i feel like i don t have anything about myself anymore,336,58,1777.876471

I let my social anxiety stop me from seeing my Dad for the last time,my dad had been fighting cancer for a couple of years and had been going downhill recently he was admitted to hospital several weeks ago and due to covid restrictions only one person could visit him a day i have severe anxiety about going into new places that is manageable when i m with my boyfriend but when i m by myself i just cannot cope the thought of going to the hospital and having to navigate it myself was far too much my dad got moved to a hospice last thursday for palliative care 2 people could now visit at a time but we were so busy with work i had planned on going to visit on the monday but we received a phone call sunday evening saying he was now unconscious and likely wouldn t wake up immediately we rushed u but he more than likely had no idea we were there he passed away on wednesday if i had gone to the hospital i would ve been able to tel him one last time that i loved him due to covid i haven t hugged this man since february as even when the restrictions were slackened i didn t want to risk passing anything onto a shielding person if i had went to the hospital i could have wrapped my arms around him one last time but my social anxiety held me back and now i don t know if i can live with myself edit i did not expect this to take off even half as much as it has i want you all to know i have read every single reply and i will respond to each i have had a pretty rough day and these uplifting messages have really gotten me through it i m going to try and get some sleep but i will definitely aim to respond to each of you tomorrow thank you all seriously this is such a kind thoughtful community,331,110,1578.373381
I just contacted the suicide hotline.,i ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a while now and i contacted the hotline once before and it went horribly and i was so scared to contact the suicide hotline again but today i decided to give it another try i used the chat line because i get too anxious when i have to talk on the phone and the guy was really helpful and he asked me if i had a plan and i lied and told him no because i was afraid of what would happen if i did tell him that i have a plan to kill myself so i told him that i was just having thoughts of suicide and that i didn t have a plan to kill myself then we just talked about what was going on and what s making me feeling this way and then we came up with a plan on what i could do tonight to keep myself distracted and busy and he gave me some coping mechanism that i could use i talked to him for about 40 minutes and he told my that i could always contact the hotline again if the thoughts comes back honestly the suicide hotline did help me this time and i felt a little better after talking with them so if you re having suicidal thoughts don t be afraid to contact your local suicide hotline it might help and if you have contacted the hotline before and have had a bad experience like i did the first time don t be afraid to try again because it kind of stopped me from doing something really bad tonight,330,43,1605.902004
Dad tried to commit suicide while on the phone with me,i never post on reddit but i just need somewhere to vent and advice so bad i m so desperate today my dad called me and told me he was going to slit his throat with a knife he had in his hand the phone call lasted probably like 45 minutes of him just going into detail about how he was going to kill him self after the phone call and him drinking so drunk it was so traumatizing to sit there and try to talk my dad down and nothing was working i was begging for him to not do it and how i love him and i had to have my boyfriend call the cops on him while i stayed on the phone he kept drinking and slamming the drink down and everytime i was terrified it was his body slamming on the floor screaming dad are you there dad dad please and him just saying he can t live and trying to give me information of his life insurance he s now in the hospital and i m waiting till the morning to go talk to him because honestly i was so traumatized by everything i couldn t go right away and see him like that drunk saying he wants to die i want to talk to him sober he s an alcoholic and depressed and i just feel so bad for not going right away but i ve had suicidal and depression problems in the past and he was so drunk i don t think he d remember me coming so i just wanted to mentally recharge so i can sit him down and talk to him about getting help because i feel like i have to be so mentally strong and be there for him it s just going to be so hard to see him and have this talk i feel so awful and guilty and scared to say the wrong thing i don t know how i m going to find the strength i m only 22 and he has no one else being that he s driven many friends away with his alcoholism and all our family lives out the country i m so desperate for any advice my heart is breaking and i don t know how i m going to do it,331,33,1810.647502

A close family member passed last year due to mental health and substance abuse issues. Today is his birthday. Please read this.,i wrote this last year when i found out he had passed it has just been sitting on my phone while the message is not a new revelation to anyone it never hurt to hear someone say these things to me so i thought that i would share it nbsp the path of life is not paved solely in joyous moments there are twisted unknown parts that lead us through the darkest of forests hills that seem insurmountable rivers that we cannot ford and past demons that others cannot see we cannot make this journey alone and we should not try we must know and remind others that there is always an ear that will listen a hand to offer aide a back to share the load and a shoulder to cry on no one must ever think that they need to face these challenges alone call on others and find the strength you need in them please know that i love you and that no matter the challenge ahead of you i will stand beside you please do not think it will ever make you lesser by asking for help it makes you stronger than you know nbsp i miss you so much james nbsp edit thank you for all of the wonderful comments,323,18,1799.332212

My close friend and roommate became a multimillionaire and I‚Äôm extremely jealous/depressed over it,my close friend that i ve known for close to a decade now has been a cofounder in a startup that started around 8 years ago he owns a pretty big share maybe 20 and i never really thought much about it because startups have such low success rates but recently i ve come to realize that they re past a point where less than 1 of startups fail after that they ve raised over 20 million dollars in investment funding so he s now worth tens of millions of dollars ever since it truly hit me i can t help but feel extremely jealous we live together at the moment and i don t feel like seeing him or speaking to him anymore out of jealousy i know that sounds horrible and i should be happy for him but i just can t help it i literally cried over this yesterday and it s making me quite depressed i m thinking of moving out after having lived together for 4 years now just so i can get this out of my head and stop thinking about it,330,110,566.9585317
When did mental illness become a trend and edgy,it sucks i used to be bullied so much throughout my entire childhood and most of my teenage years for being different i liked weird stuff and never took anything seriously nothing had value i had it become worse because everytime i tried doing better and failed it lead to things becoming worse socially now i go on anytime of social media and all the sudden everyone who bullied me and shit are now all some type of mentally ill all for a trend but the fact i actually was was scoffed at by the same people just has me so angry like i worked so hard to try and become better and get a little stable then everyone else just hoped on it it just doesn t make sense why you d want to romanticise mental illness edit i m not trying to dismiss those who came out with mental illness it s the people who make it a trend overly self diagnose and say they have things you know for a fact they don t for a trend,327,79,1451.803566
Anyone else feel like they can't trust their own thoughts and feelings?,i have a therapist i m going to sessions it s difficult to talk to her because i never know if my feelings are real or if i m just imagining them being too dramatic about them it s so hard to answer questions about and how does that make you feel and and what do you think about this thing that happened and why do you think that is and what do you mean when you say that and describe your feelings when i don t know what to say or even think when the therapist asks me these every time i answer clumsily and feeling fake while doing ir the words sound silly and like i m overreacting and then my head starts to doubt itself my internal monologue starts diminishing what i ve just said the minute i say it out loud you re being very dramatic is this true though are you sure the therapist isn t laughing at you right now she probably thinks you re undeserving of the help but she wants the money your mom would say you re being ridiculous right now your problems are stupid compared to x how do you counter that,324,25,2197.349492
I was finally accurately diagnosed after 12 years thanks to the show 'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend',throwaway account for reasons that may be obvious and a spoiler for season 3 of the show let me start off by giving you guys some backstory i have been in therapy for a wide array of issues compulsive spending depression anxiety manic episodes suicidal attempts i attempted many times to get a diagnosis but i wouldn t share any embarrassing details that i will share with you every psychiatrist i would see would base these disorders off as the result of childhood trauma and an absent father i was on all the medications you ve probably heard of buspar prozac xanax and zoloft my relationships have never really been stable in both interpersonal and romantic areas i ve had 3 romantic relationships my entire life with the longest relationship lasting 6 months whenever i developed feelings for someone it would turn into severe infatuation where it went as far as stalking rearranging my work schedule to be able to interact with him and try to change my physical appearance in order to get them to fall for me i am not proud of any of this but i need to stop denying that this was happening with friendships whenever a friend would cancel plans like drinks at the bar i would fall into a severe depression where suicidal thoughts would come to mind i would call these friends and tell them i was considering suicide in order to get them to come see me my manic episodes started getting pretty severe over the past few months to the point where i would take a week off from work and take lavish spontaneous trips to europe i started having auditory hallucinations of a sane me insulting me and calling me crazy i would go to vegas on weekends to go on an alcohol binger and have numerous random sexual encounters i would also lock myself in my room after work and watch tv for 6 hours straight i will admit i was too ashamed to open up about this as i was scared of being institutionalized and being known in my family as the freak in august i wanted to start watching a new show and came across the show crazy ex girlfriend i had heard of the show before but because of the name i thought it was related to the meme i had grown annoyed of so i never really gave it a chance as i started watching i was horrified that there were a few similarities between myself and the character rebecca bunch the stalking lavish spending fear of abandonment the hallucinations the fact that she was the titular crazy ex girlfriend left me in a slight depression and i almost stopped watching however when i reached season 3 where rebecca finally gets diagnosed with borderline personality disorder i decided to finally go to a new psychiatrist to get another opinion and decided not to hold back any information that i was scared would be regarded as crazy people behavior thanks to the show s portrayal of mental illness i was finally able to open up about the stalking the auditory hallucinations and everything in between after 12 years of therapy my official diagnosis is self destructive borderline and while the road to recovery will be a long one i am hopeful that someday i will be able to completely manage my bpd if you re currently going through something similar know that you aren t alone and the medical professionals are there to help you not judge you tldr was an undiagnosed borderline for 12 years but thanks to the show s portrayal of mental illness i finally opened up about topics i was ashamed to admit finally getting an accurate diagnosis,330,10,2312.004423
Do men go thru something in their 30s-40s that affect their emotions?,husband 35 stated he feels numb doesn t care about anything he said he doesn t feel love toward anyone and we have kids he tries for our kids but he says he doesn t feel nothing for them either he said he doesn t hate his life or isn t mad or sad he doesn t want to hurt himself he just said he s content but not happy he s going to therapy but therapist says he s not depressed it s something that happens to men in their 30s 40s it just something that triggers in them and they are the only ones to figure it out but that sometimes they never come out of it my husband was never like this he was always loving and affectionate towards me and our kids my husband is the only one working and works almost everyday so i thought this is what caused it but he said no that it s just turning 35 and seeing people around him dying or getting sick from old age his therapist told him to take a trip alone for a week and that is what he is going to do i don t know is anyone going thru this or knows what this is if so can people get better update so we are divorcing he told me he wants to sleep with other women on his vacation so i m done with him i m going to keep this post up since it gives people a chance to share there stories i really appreciate everyone for this stories and their good luck wishes i wish you all the best and pray you overcome this hard time in your lives take care,331,212,518.7743997
I lost it over my son's hair,yesterday i noticed that my son had been chewing on a lock of his hair no big deal lots of kids do that i explained why he can t and that we need to trim some of his hair to deal with the damage he did to it it was pretty torn up in one spot his is super proud of his long hair it was down to the middle of his back when it is wet and to his shoulders dry because of his curls my mom when to beauty school years ago and offered to cut it for me i was very hesitant because my family jokes about cutting his hair behind my back i told her to only cut it to his shoulders but she gave him basically her hair cut which it the short old lady cut that she and my grandma have it looks awful and i asked her to stop but she kept insisting that she needed to even it out by the time she was done i was in tears i ran out to the car to calm down so the kids didn t see me cry my mom came out and made jokes about how i m not speaking to her and laughed and asked if she could cut my hair next i took the kids home and fed them and attempted to put his hair in his braids that i always do but it is too short i had a full meltdown after the kids when to bed and basically hyperventilated on my kitchen floor i m so angry that my chest hurts and i asked my son after i was calm what he wanted to do with it and he said please don t take any more of my hair i know i m more upset then he is but she just steamrolled me she wouldn t listen,322,79,1445.742525

Did my mom sexually assault me? Its not sexually motivated by it definitely felt violating.,my mom has always been sadistic towards me she would drag me by the hair and cut it like a maniac as some punishment then tell me how ugly i look or she would watch me throwing up on the floor and not help cos i m being punished however there are instances when i do something that would dishonour the family she would try to strip me down infront of my own brothers violently pulling at my clothes while i try to cover myself one time she told me to get naked and bend over the bed so she could check if my hymen was intact i feel nothing but anger tbh i normalised that behaviour from her so much that it didn t bother me after some time it doesn t bother me when someone molests me in public either i think i achieved that level of apathy and indifference by dissociation myself from my body i consider my body as a vessel i am in and when someone hurts or violates it they are violating the vessel and not me personally i do feel anger though at her and everything she put me through so ig i feel smth can i call these experiences sexual abuse edit thanks for everyone s kind words and thanks to everyone who opened up about similar experiences i wanted to assure everyone that i am 23 now last time i was sexually abused by her was a couple months prior to leaving the country at 18 i don t have to see my family for another year i wanted to discuss this in therapy but i just couldn t find the words to describe it ig i didn t know what to label it as now i know what to call it i can communicate it better in therapy sadly the idea of mental health is very undeveloped in my country and showing any signs of abnormality can be dangerous that s why i cant call any authorities or ask anyone for help,323,57,1231.425025
I am furious with our mental health system!,a child of mine admitted to me some pretty disturbing things that are going on with him mentally i brought him to a local mental health urgent care who turned us away because our insurance wasnt one they accepted ooookay went to the only other one they accept us but it has taken 7 hours for the intake process only to be sent to a hospital to get a med eval before we can get a bed for him now its nearly 8 hours later and we still arent to the place with the bed for him and still just waiting and waiting what kind of help is this if someone were an immediate harm to themselves this is enough to drive them over the edge i want to pull my hair out at this point oh and because youre a risk they cant even turn the tv on for us at the hospital because of a no electronics rule so theres nothing to even look at or do while we wait 7 hours of staring at a damn wall this is absolutely maddening i hate this all of this,331,100,1242.859955
Do you ever wonder how people seem to have energy to do literally anything but bare minimum?,idk what it is but it s been so frustrating the last few years it takes so much energy for me to do one chore activity anything that isn t considered passive entertainment even if it s something i think of as fun and enjoyable i envy people who are able to just wake up get out of bed and start their day i honestly can only do that if i have a specific place to be and people are relying on my where do they get their energy from,329,71,2291.652779
Was I raped?,i m not sure if this even belongs here you can delete it if it doesn t about 8 years ago i had a threesome with a married couple who i d known since we were kids the deal was he wouldn t be with me but we d both be with her which i agreed to it was a fun night and afterwards i fell asleep i woke up some time later with someone spooning me groping me and kissing the back of my neck i tried to push them off i had no idea who it was or what was happening when i realized it was the husband i said no please stop several times but he wouldn t listen and kept fighting me eventually i just gave in he sodomized me and after he finished made me promise to never tell his wife liz she had left us alone to go pick someone up at the airport tbh i never had a lot of self esteem and to say i felt humiliated is an understatement i didn t want it to happen but i let it happen anyway i could ve protested more maybe if i did it wouldn t of happened i went home i was bleeding a lot one of my roommate noticed and asked me what happened after a while of her whining i told her and she said well that s what you get for whoring around i accepted what she said and after that i never told anyone about it not even my therapists it s something i try to not dwell over but when i think about it i feel gross and sad edit i just want to say thank you all for the supportive comments it means a lot truly to the people saying i should tell the wife it took a lot just to share this with strangers on a subreddit the guilt and shame are very real i can t just walk up to the wife and tell her your husband raped me i m sure he ll deny it if she questions him and why would she even believe me over her husband i don t know their relationship but from what i gather they live a good life with 2 children i do know how devastating it is not to be believed i m also familiar with their extended family they will try to bury me alive it s too much,327,77,1100.219087

"I started turning off and locking my phone away every weekend, and it's liberating",this may not apply to everyone but for me a person who is severely addicted to instagram and messaging apps it s just really liberating i bought this locking device that allows you to lock something in it and set a time for it to reopen not naming any brand here everyone please don t make this a post about products i started out by locking my phone for a few hours then a whole day and eventually a whole weekend it is surprisingly beneficial to my mental health i am a hypersensitive type and love to overread and overthink anything anyone say to me and i also don t have a life so what happen is that i need to constantly chat with my friends and family even to the point that may annoy them and when they show a lil bit of disinterest even when they are really just busy i d literally feel hurt it sounds so stupid to say such thing as a grown ass person but yes and i really hate myself for that once i locked my phone my brain will immediately try to find substitutes to generate the same stimulation sometimes i d use my computer to browse the internet but using the computer just never brings me the same negativity that a phone does same as how youtube and reddit are somehow just much less toxic than ig and whatsapp to me i don t play video games and my social circles don t use facebook anymore so i normally can shut my computer pretty quick because i feel bored again and weird enough the next thing i know is that i find myself actually get up from my lazy ass and start doing things like chores sorting mails and even doing some exercise i don t think i am anywhere near being mentally healthy but seriously i am much much better off without that damn phone edit sorry guys i can t pm the brand of the device it s against the rule you can generally search timed locking box and anything similar will do there are many boxes that do it edit the point of this post is really just to put your phone away and you will instantly feel better once you can detach from the toxicity and focus on yourself,322,23,1412.335245

"If you live in America, Good luck with affording Mental Health Perscriptions",speaking from my own personal experiences america doesn t care about your mental health do you need a new ssri that s come out in the past 10 years that helps you a lot how about you pay over 1 000 for it oops you need that medication to save your life and don t have insurance sorry here in america we don t consider mental health or health in general important so i guess that just means you ll just have to go without it guess you ll just have to worry every day of your life about whether or not you can afford basic mental health care as of right now i recommend to all of you in america to switch from your current pharmacy to publix or other cheap pharmacy and get an rx card i still can t afford trintellix but at least lexapro has been around long enough to afford it i m so happy to have grown up in a conservative family that never got me mental health adhd help ever until i m an adult so that now i can t afford it it makes me so happy to be in a society that belives my mental health isn t important and that i should just suck it up and get back to work which i can t because of covid 19 ddddd,317,73,1784.041853

I'm tired of this shit.,i really hate when people believe that i m mentally unstable only for attention it makes me so angry being mental unstable is not fun at all i really wish that i was not in this way i m so tired of that shit people have litterally told me you re so edgy that s cringe you did that for attention didn t you hearing this makes me sad and angry and these people are the reason why i never open up to people because i m afraid that they will just judge me some people can be so rude,319,65,1509.416923
I no longer want to die.,this time 2 months ago i was 34 weeks pregnant with an adoption plan in place to relinquish my baby at birth after years of suffering heavily with my mental health i thought i was too fucked up to be able to love a child no maternal instincts i couldn t even look after myself how the fuck would i look after a baby i thought it d be cruel to subject a child to a lifetime with me that my baby would be better with someone else i concealed the pregnancy from my entire family i d completely isolated myself from everybody convinced that i would give birth give up my baby and never tell a soul the isolation spending weeks on end alone in a flat without leaving the house led to a massive decline in my already dire mental health at 8 months pregnant an ambulance was called to me at a multi story car park at 3am i couldn t do it not when there was only a few weeks to go as much as i wanted to die i figured i d hang on just 4 more weeks until my baby was born then i d do it this led to many services getting involved social workers specialist midwives the crisis team the home treatment team and even perinatal mental health specialists i m not going to go into detail about the home environment i was in because it still pains me to this day but it was heavily infested with rats only one window to the whole place but because i was heavily pregnant suffering with carpal tunnel and could no longer work i m self employed no maternity leave pay i was stuck there in this dungeon 8 months pregnant stuck in a dark hell hole i couldn t go outside due to concealing my pregnancy listening to rats chewing through the walls around me i was so ready to die then my family tried to barge in convinced that i had fallen into a horrible drug addiction or worse was rotting away alone i promised that i would see them the next day and tell them what was happening they thought this was me being ready to open up get help when really it was me giving up i had nothing left to lose i planned on being dead soon anyway and i missed them during my pregnancy because of me concealing it i had to miss seeing my mother in hospital after she was rushed in for emergency surgery my family dog dying i never got to say goodbye and the death of my aunty and her funeral i figured if i was going to die soon i wanted to spend my last bit of time with them i was surrendering the adoption plan was in place my baby would have a good life my family were supportive as i knew they would be many services presumed my reason for hiding the pregnancy from them was out of fear but it was the opposite i m lucky to come from a loving wealthy family who i didn t want to change my mind i wanted to die my family begged me not to go through with the adoption my mother offering to take full custody of my baby if i tried motherhood and didn t like it i wanted them to be happy i thought he could be my replacement when i was gone that he d keep them busy and take some weight off their grief of losing me i agreed my mother got me to move back in with her and i enjoyed the luxuries of sleeping at night not worrying about rats crawling over me and having access to hot water again 12 days after i told my family i was pregnant my beautiful baby boy was born 3 weeks early from the second i first held him he was my boy and he wasn t going anywhere from the moment he was here it s like my mental illness has been an awful boot camp that i ve finally graduated like all my suffering is now worth something as you ll know bpd amplified all emotions i feel everything so intensely my emotions are like a physical sensation in the past this has caused me so much pain and heartbreak until the second i first held my son and the feeling of maternal love flooded me with the most intense incredible feeling i could ever imagine something i never imagined i could feel that i thought i was too fucked up to experience came to me so naturally and now i have a little human who i can love as much as i want and it doesn t aggravate him i m never too much for him because he needs me and depends on me fully how can i possibly be suicidal anymore when i have my baby who will always need me all those nights i ve spent awake all hours in tears seem like preparation for the sleepless nights of having a newborn minus the tears my baby has become my fixation and the best part he wants all of my love he doesn t want space from me and i m never alone anymore i have somebody to be strong for do i still feel like shit sometimes absolutely but i don t get the chance to feel like shit for too long cause my baby keeps me busy my overthinking myself into depressive episodes don t have the time anymore my boy needs me i never imagined being a mother and i never imagined getting better which i m still not fully but i m the best i ve been in years and for the first time in a truly long time i m no longer suicidal i want to be here i want to care for my son make sure he s so loved that he ll never feel unwanted like i have and with him around i can t imagine feeling unwanted for a long time until he s old enough for me to be embarrassing it s like all the love that i ve had to give finally has a place to go i m so happy i look at him and i just want to do right by him to be the best mother i can be 2 months ago i was 8 months pregnant isolated from everybody in a dark rat infested flat planning on ending my life now i m currently led on my big comfy double bed watching my 6 week old baby sleeping peacefully beside me in his moses basket in a nice light clean house smiling to myself and making plans for our future i always rolled my eyes when people told me it gets better i d suffered over a decade of things just getting worse until this year i d finally hit rock bottom now i m on top of the world i ve never been happier than i have being a mother it s been so long since i ve truly enjoyed being alive this turned into a huge essay but i don t like sharing this too much irl because of the shame and embarrassment of living in such poor conditions the state my mental health had got to and also now that he s here it breaks my heart to think i ever even considered adoption i ve been heavily and closely monitored by many services and in the 6 weeks since his birth i ve been discharged by 4 and have reduced visits from daily to fortnightly monthly by all of them they all tell me how amazing i m doing at being a mother and how in their professions it s so nice to see a happy ending i feel like i m finally good enough at something and that s being his mummy sorry to go on i just wanted to share my story and hopefully inspire others that sometimes things do get better maybe your turnaround will be nothing like mine and i m not at all suggesting having a baby will cure your mental illness but for me this is finally me coming out of the other side i m finally happy at 22 years old and a decade of diagnosed mental health problems i don t want to die anymore,321,20,1975.966691
Why is mental health care so inaccessible?,everyone s advice is always talk to a professional but nobody will acknowledge how impossible that is i work a full time job with benefits financially i m not rich but i m not poor my insurance supposedly covers mental health services but i recently made the call for a referral and i was only given a list of 3 providers none of them are accepting new patients and even if they were i can t find enough info on them online to even know if they will be a good fit for me there are a few providers in town that i think i would feel really comfortable with but they are not covered under my insurance and i cannot afford to pay out of pocket i make enough that i don t qualify for sliding scale but not enough to actually pay the full rates this is ridiculous to me that at this point in my life i am more financially stable than i ever have been and quite frankly pretty privileged in terms of money yet i cannot get decent mental health care honestly it scares me and it makes me feel a bit hopeless i ve been going back and forth with even wanting help and it took a lot for me to finally decide to make that phone call i m super disappointed that i am not finding anything that can help me,317,107,2105.796657

I almost killed myself and it's made me no longer suicidal,two nights ago i was on a building with one leg hanging over the edge i d called police so that they could find my body and was trying to pull myself over the edge but i couldn t do it in that moment i realised i didn t want to die just that i m severely depressed it s been liberating ever since i m no longer mourning for myself or constantly thinking about suicide so i m feeling a bit better i ve started planning for the future again which is a nice distraction from the way i feel i m not saying anyone should put themselves in this position to test it or anything just that no matter how suicidal you feel there s always a part of you that wants to survive because that s our human instinct listen to that part you can do this 3,317,43,1250.860731

My boyfriend killed himself and now I want to too ,we were together for 8 years and knew each other for 10 i even hate saying boyfriend because people take our relationship less seriously but our relationship was deep and we were each others person we never married because we didn t wanna follow societies rules i loved that we always had that understanding and at least we always had each other but now he s gone and left me on this god for saken planet to deal with his family and my own life which isn t even much of a life it s been about a month in a half i know it happened i know but i ve been in denial for the most part i went to his celebration of life i read his note i saw his death certificate i m in very complicated grief but we were supposed to stick this shitty ass life out together and now he s gone how could he do this to me i m so hurt and mad and i don t want to keep living anymore im supposed to go to work and act like everything s okay and keep paying bills and live life for a life not worth living the only thing i m living for is my mom but that s honestly kind of dark it s like i m hoping she passes soon so i can leave this miserable life some days i don t even know if i m strong enough to wait for her i m tired of being in pain just living anytime i go out and live life i hate it and it just reminds me of why i should ve never been born living just to not to upset others at this point,318,55,327.8085433
I have always been under the impression nobody notices me‚Ä¶,today i was sat next to a person with really cute hair and i kind of wanted to compliment them but they had ear plugs in so i didn t know if i could well when they were about to get off the bus they handed me a note they had written on their bus ticket i was honestly confused and intrigued i look at the note and it essentially reads that they think i seem cool and if i d like a friend i can message them and gave me their details of sorts honestly i would ve never seen this coming from a million miles away and i feel so ecstatic and joyful that someone noticed me i was under the impression that i m a nobody that no one ever pays attention to but clearly that s not true i don t know whether to cry or run around in happiness all i know is i m really really happy i hope this is the right subreddit for this i do suffer from mental health issues which is why i tend to feel like someone unimportant who nobody would approach this event though makes my day,318,29,848.3249553

Getting a cat helped my mental health,i was going through a really rough time as far as my mental health goes my therapist wasn t the right one for me so i quit going and was really not feeling so great and was in a pretty dark place my roommate and i decided to get a cat and ever since my mood has definitely improved the first few months he hid and was super anxious and i was like same dude then after a while he decided he could trust us and have been amazing he sleeps in my bed every night and loves to talk to me it s really nice having him there when my roommate isn t home his presence makes me feel a little less alone i still struggle with it but he s made it a little easier cause i have this cute little guy that s always happy to see me just thought i d share this for anyone who is thinking about getting an esa or just wanted something nice to read,313,40,2157.25962
I hate my boobs,the title says it all i thought i d eventually get over this but it s really been taking a toll on me for reference i m a 34b it s reached the point where i can t go out without an extremely padded push up bra but when i get home and take it off i m hit with the harsh reality of how i actually look it s like a constant reminder that no matter how much i try to boost my appearance it s just not the same i feel less like a woman and genuinely believe that no one will ever love me because of how i look what hurts the most is knowing that the only way to change this might be through a cosmetic procedure but those are very expensive and i don t have the funds for that i ve tried everything gaining weight which is tough due to my fast metabolism and supplements but nothing seems to make a difference i feel like i don t deserve to be taken seriously by men and while i know people say life isn t all about men and i wholeheartedly agree i still want them to find me attractive because they re my preferred gender but i feel like i will never achieve that because of the way my body is,314,365,212.7637289
I'm a 40+ year old man with two young boys and a wife. I need to brain dump.,firstly i just need this out of my head i am not posting for attention or answers i just need to get this all out without effecting someone else with my worries or just downright dumb thoughts i ve been messing up again not knowing what s going on with schools and if they will close them again or if they will just keep going until kids start dropping i don t know if i m really worried if i ve been made to feel that way i don t know because the people in power are less honest than my 6 year old he s six he was just 1 my other is 4 but he was just born it feels like i m 41 and my kids are 6 and 4 how much longer do i have where i will be mentally fit to care for them or will i just be the old ass cranky dad who forgot what it s like to feel the magic of being a child i haven t yet but one day i will will i make a big enough impact in my sons lives then when i die they will miss me will they talk about me with pride or will it be all the ways i failed i m so scared to screw up being a father that it is crippling my father wasn t a father he was there he didn t beat me or hurt me or scream at me for that he would have had to actually care i was alive i haven t spoke to him in years and i don t see that ever changing my mom my mother the most racist horrible mean scorned and damaged person i have ever met i love her but i don t ever want to see them again i m white my wife is black we have two mixed boys the world is so messed up will my boys be treated different will they be looked down on will they not get chances because of it or will someone hand them something just because they are mixed why in the hell do i worry about this will they get killed at school will i be able to save them if they are in danger how do i cook a fucking hamburger on the stove without it turning to shit i can t even fix the damn toilet that keeps clogging because i was never shown how to be a man and i know the world is different and it might not be right but it feels that way i have nothing to be proud of what my kids and wife how in the hell has she not left me yet i m the most annoying person you could meet i started puking again i can t handle this i used to be skinny and fast and strong now my knees hurt the other day i hurt my neck from standing up it hurt for three days i feel like there is nothing useful in me anymore i m 41 and anything that mattered is gone now i only have jobs i have a job to raise my children to be great humans who don t hate i have to teach my wife how to prepare for when i die i have to make sure everyone is okay and taken care of so when i die they are okay so what about while i m alive i get that i don t matter in the long run my children do but i am sick of being here on earth i m scared i m mentally alone i make myself feel this way and i don t know why i just want a life i can t have i try to make things like they were like all the horrid holidays when i was a child i try to make so beyond special for my kids that i ve spoiled them and now nothing means anything i just want to feel like i m wanted again not needed i wish i had a friend but i m terrified of people i can t even order at a drive thru without going into a minor panic attack and ordering too much i m starting to mentally crack at the smallest things i don t yell or scream i go sit in the garage and cry so no one knows it so when someone askes me why i m sad and i explain it they can t follow up with well what you need to do is or you shouldn t feel no shit i m not doing it for attention and i didn t say it was rational but i m a grown ass man and i should not feel like this i should not feel like i only matter because of responsibilities i just want someone to have a better day just because i am in their life why is it so wrong to want to feel good about something to be noticed for something besides can i have a snack or because 99 of every decision that has to be made has to be made by me or it doesn t get made i m stretched too thin i m not superman i can t do it all i can t always make a decision i m human and right now i m scared and i m not dealing with it okay i knew that when i started to puke after i eat there is this spot in the back and side of my mouth that if i tap with a straw i can empty my stomach in 10 seconds so now i eat once a day and i notice that my belly stays now my whole life i could never gain a pound 140 was the most i ever got then i was 160 and my stomach was gone now it was bigger i was short of breath my hair is gray in spots i m getting older i m already old and one day i ll die and idk what that is either but i know that it doesn t matter what good i do what will matter the most is what i wasn t able to do the areas where i failed because no one is perfect so i am going to fail and that is the one thing i cannot afford to do i m not asking for a pity party i m not asking for a damn thing i just needed this out but i will say that being a man makes this harder men are treated different when they talk about mental health if i could just man up i would and i do every damn day i man up i do my job i take care of my family and i m damn good at it but sometimes it all comes in at me sometimes i get a chance to sit and think and that is scary i live my life on autopilot when i stop to think is when it s bad i don t know any of you but i hope you are all happy we live in an age where it s almost comical for people say they just want to be happy but it s not there is nothing wrong with wanting to be loved or wanted to be noticed x200b edit the best thing i did for myself was post this i was terrified to post it and you made me not only feel welcomed but that i matter and i don t know any of you you helped me cope you gave me things to think about you

I am a broken man both mentally and physically. So I jumped on a bike and started pedalling across the country. I'm not stopping until I hit the other side.,hi everyone about a month ago i started to think about cycling across country two weeks later i left moncton nb at 1pm in the afternoon and haven t looked back tomorrow i will cross into quebec i think this is interesting for a few reasons 1 as i said i am fat and out of shape i am 44m 6 5 320lbs and have not exercised in any meaningful way in 20 years i have bad knees bad back apnea and i m type 2 diabetic 2 mentally i m broken i suffer from really bad depression bipolar 2 and chemicaly induced anxiety disorder 3 i was raised as a ward of the court 30 foster homes street kid jail addiction been a hard road so why on earth am i doing this two main reasons first and foremost bc is my home province they recently passed into law funding for school for former wards of the court regardless of age i plan on taking full advantage of this and i think this should be the standard across all provinces i have stagnated in the same industry for years and have hit a ceiling if i ever want to retire and leave something behind for my girls i need something more and education is where i ll start secondly if i am to be successful with my schooling i need to get my head in order because of my ciad i can t take antidepressants so all my mental health issues i tackle on my own and frankly depression is winning i could fly out to bc and be there 12hrs from now but i will end up being the same man however the man that can jump on a bike and pedal his ass all the way to vancouver island that man can do anything he can regain control of his mental health he can regain his physical health and he can dedicate a healthy body and mind to his schooling so i want to try and bring some awareness to the mental health struggles and the ward of the court funding thing it s been over two weeks since i ve left and there s been some hard dark moments but there s been some empowering ones too i m already down about 20lbs there s strength in my legs and back ive not felt since i was a teenager i m about to cross into a new province and i thought it was worth sharing with this community i have already been posting in another subreddit since i started and they ve all been so amazing i have been posting almost daily updates to my insta and tiktok but if i understand correctly i can t link them here on this subreddit i also have a blog i ve been writing when i have time both the blog and videos are not a magical xmas land type of upbeat energetic thing i talk about and show both the ups and downs of mental health and this monumental challenge i ve taken on i hope there s a few of you who might pass me on your drives don t hesitate giving me a honk or a wave i ll be the big fat guy on a mountain bike thanks,312,68,648.8765182

"My Mom passed in September, today a neighbor asked my Dad on a date.

The system in American is directly related to the current mental health crisis sweeping the nation.,does being unproductive make you feel worthless does the anxiety of paying for college only to work a job you have no passion for set you over the edge we are basically paying our lives away to survive we go to school to get a degree only to work a job to pay bills i understand that are other routes to take but for a majority of people this is unrealistic not everyone has the capital to be an entrepreneur not everyone has the time to sit down and develop their skills in american we are slaves to the system until we die we work until we are full we pay bills until we are poor we are deprived of happiness through means labor to gain profit for people in power humans were not meant to work 40 hours of week to have two days of freedom during the week we are worth more than what we are able to produce to society,311,40,1556.02572

Mental illness can be comfortable,when it comes to mental illness recovery we don t talk enough about leaving the comfort of sadness and then when we try to get better it starts feeling uncomfortable to discover who we are outside of this sadness that has felt like a fundamental part of us for years you ve been practically nested in this sadness so your brain naturally tries to take you back to this state yet emotions feelings and physical states are fluid yes they are part of us but they do not define us still we let it define us because it feels so comfortable therefore the real challenge is to find yourself outside of this sadness who did you used to be who can you be,311,63,884.4804071
i'm so tired of being told I'm overreacting whenever I get emotional,i 23f was diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder a year or so ago and it has made a lot of things make a lot of sense i have very low self esteem and frequently deal with thoughts of not being good enough and feeling like people wouldn t miss me if i wasn t here when people give me reasons to believe those thoughts it fucks me up when my mom didn t call me on my birthday i spent the whole day depressed because i thought she didn t care enough to remember when my family dog had to be put down suddenly i was the last one to be told and had it not been for my brother convincing my dad to call me i wouldn t have known until the next morning when she would ve already been dead for hours my dad got a new dog yesterday which i again wasn t told until everyone else had known for a while he didn t even tell me my brother accidentally let it slip after they d been to see it and was asked if they wanted to take her home with them for a few hours as a trial run to anyone else these would be things easily shrugged off but they really get to me family is supposed to be the people who will want to be around you no matter what yet i feel they try to avoid me and it sucks on top of that when i get emotional over these things i get told i need to get my shit together and stop being to overdramatic i talked to my brother about the dog incident and he told me to stop being so dramatic and that this wasn t a big deal to him it wasn t to me it is this argument has me in fucking tears cause i m a mess my whole life i ve been told my feelings are too much i was the quiet shy kid and was never the one to get attention however when i was bullied at school and at home and developed anxiety i tried my best to get attention the only way i knew how pretending to be sick after the teachers caught on that i was faking they eventually stopped caring and let me walk around the school yard crying it took me so long to realize i was crying because i was extremely anxious and was begging for help now having been told my entire life that i m just overreacting that s also how i speak to myself i ll have a literal panic attack and the only thought in my head is that i m faking i still don t actually believe my panic attacks are real even though the symptoms match up perfectly but my brain will never give me the benefit of the doubt i m sorry for the long rant even posting this i m expecting people to tell me i just need to get my shit together i hate hating myself so much,312,50,954.3454766
It sucks when you realize you weren't as good of a person as you thought you were,you know it just blows when you look back and you were so blissfully unaware that what you thought was the right thing or at least that you did your best truly wasn t it s tough and sure i was absolutely the product of my environment i m sure if i were raised in a different home i would have been and would be now a much better person but at the end of the day i said did those things and my rightful punishment is to be forever embarrassed by them,309,34,1132.661507

Does anyone feel frustrated being surrounded by people who don't recognize mental health is just as important as physical health?,i unfortunately imo come from a country where mental health is usually overlooked if not completely ignored therapy is not available and people would say i m making excuses for being lazy stupid if i tell them about my mental health issues since i was a kid i ve always been someone who is emotional easily triggered easily stressed out and tends to overthink everyone even my parents sees me as weak oversensitive and dramatic they don t believe one can be struggling mentally when they look just fine and normal physically there were some critical points in my life when i got panic attacks and cried everyday i couldn t eat or sleep and was losing weight but my parents were totally helpless and clueless because i didn t seem to be sick anywhere looking from the outside i don t blame my parents for neglecting my mental health though they live in such conservative society and had a hard time making ends meet so i doubt they even have time to learn about something so foreign to them i blame the whole cultural stigma in general i feel like a misfit i just wish i could get out of this prejudiced place asap move to a different country where mental health is prioritized where people understand me and i m not considered crazy i want to get my thoughts out there and see if anyone else shares the similar problem where you live please leave me comments i would love to hear your experience opinion on this wherever you are from,310,25,1500.524296

Being addicted to daydreaming (Maladaptive daydreaming),hey um i recently found out about this disorder i put it in quotes because it is not actually recognized by the dsm it is when people daydream very extensively for sometimes hours a day they create their own highly structured universes and scenarios that help them cope with drama etc they often have the urge to that as soon as they wake up also while doing that a lot of people engage on repetitive movement like pacing around i have heard that psychologists suspect that it activates certain areas in the brain that control your imagination or might effect it in a hypnotic way excuse my wording i am not a native speaker lol those people do not gaslight themself in fact most of mders are able to tell which of their memories are within their paracosm imagination and which are not effects of this intense daydreaming is that people with that disorder sometimes find it very hard to focus on anything some people argue that daydreaming is natural and md should not be regarded as a mental illness i think it certainly has characteristics of a mental illness it is a coping mechanism at the beginning but at some point mders find themself daydreaming all day because they got so used to living in this paracosm that they don t enjoy reality as much anymore and this is an endless circle because if you don t do stuff with other people or your friends and avoid your responsibilities and flee in your paracosm your live will get more miserable and your imagined friends scenarios and word will look more and more appealing i recently found out that i might have this disorder i have stumbled across this because i had problems with not being able to live in the present a lot of my scenarios are about my future and they are often highly fantastical so instead of actually doing stuff that might bring me to a future that i might enjoy i just dream about already being there since then i am always searching for new information on this subject and one researcher that does amazing work within this field is eli somer he was the first one who recognized it and publishes a lot of videos about md on youtube here is his channel if you have any thoughts or further research sources please drop them here and especially if you have experience with this subject first hand i just want people to know that this is real and effects people thanks for reading,309,67,1523.339308
Even if nobody reads this..,writing is a form of therapy that releases the pressure in my heart and brain and allows me to cope it helps me make sense of and mop up the gray matter i have felt pain i have felt joy i have felt grief and i have feared for my life but nothing matches the nameless emotion waging war on me for those who don t personally know me i am making a drastic move for the betterment of myself and my family financially and this is the battle i m facing inside i ve felt so absent from myself and completely empty watching my house go from years of being the safe place for sailors laughter gatherings hot meals and an ear to thin bare walls and empty rooms broke me in ways i never thought possible people i ve loved have weaved in and out of those rooms without thought in search of a place to call home and here i am staring at the worn paint and marks along the walls from memories of beer pong twister and indoor dodgeball amongst other absurd things wondering where the time went and if i ll ever feel family like i have over the several years i ve built and nurtured my circle i don t believe for a single moment that i wasn t meant to experience the connections and the love that i ve felt here but with that comes the inevitable goodbyes the halting end of a time that saved my life nothing teaches you how to introduce yourself and part ways all in the same breath quite like the navy but it never gets easier no more dinners with friends gathering around the table to feel a sense of family where our respective families are absent no more beer pong nights with 90 s hits or spontaneous card game nights my world has fallen silent laughter became tears joy became pain and i don t know what to do with the things that i feel you d think i d be good at this as i ve been away from those i love and grew up with for 7 years however i am not i am truly weak inside and empty i didn t know how else to express the grief that i feel other than to write this out though i know not many will make it this far into the novels that i write about my internal war please hold your friends close while you have the time because tomorrow you could be moving across the country with nothing but a back pack and shoes and nobody to walk beside you and that pain i don t think anyone deserves to feel,309,36,1579.026183
Schizophrenia is very stigmatized,i was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia and this disorder is very stigmatized people think we are going to kill people or obey the voices we hear it s all 100 not true there are some schizophrenics who never killed people john nash the mathematician brian wilson the singer songwriter of the beach boys daniel johnston a singer songwriter we aren t harmful some of us are just scared we don t kill nor plan to kill you we get paranoid but we try to heal it before it gets worse to me depression can be just as bad as schizophrenia any mental disorder really can be just as bad as any disorder suicide being the issue,310,35,1692.356229
Why are you so quiet?,maybe because half the time i speak no one listens maybe because no one takes me seriously maybe because i get interrupted and spoken over all the time maybe i don t speak because no one wants to hear me maybe i just don t see the point in trying this is what i really want to tell people when they ask why i m so quiet,308,56,1995.099551
Does anyone else feel like quality of life is one of the major causes of mental health problems but nobody seems to talk about that part?,there s a lot of people who struggle hard just to have the most basic comforts in life food shelter peace are all simple things that everybody should have but many people fight hard to get that definitely plays a huge role is people who have depression anxiety stress guilt and those types of things could snowball into more serious issues imo quality of life is what drives a lot of people to the state of mind where they could end up as some under achieving individual who has settled for a mediocre life instead of pursuing higher goals or a homicidal suicidal person or anything in between,308,50,2307.976507
"I was feeling extra bad today, so I grabbed some cheap paints and started an episode of Bob Ross: Beauty is Everywhere",here s what i made it s certainly no masterpiece but i had lots of fun making it especially with this little nugget watching my every move if you re in a bad place sometimes the smallest things can feel impossible or overwhelming and that s okay everyone should take their time to warm up to certain activities if you re on the fence about trying something creative though i highly recommend just giving it a go it s always nice to express yourself through different mediums and painting is certainly a fun one,308,24,2325.626715
A Lush Employee bought me a bathbomb today and it may have saved my life.,i hit rock bottom a couple years ago and lost everything due to clinical burnout mental illness trauma and multiple deaths in my immediate family i had no income because everyday i was struggling to keep myself alive and couldn t work so my bills stacked up quick from only being able to make minimum payments and sometimes having to delay payments so i could eat this year has been a huge turning point for me and i was able to get a job that i love but it s only part time and i had to do a slow return to prevent burnout i ve been slowly paying back my bills but i guess someone got fed up with me and the bank ended up taking all my money for this month i found out in lush when i tried to buy a single bathbomb for my aching muscles after long retail hours my card declined i played it off and left the store in a panic trying to figure out why i didn t have five dollars and i saw that the bank drained my account my face must have given me away because the cashier ran out of the store with the bathbomb i d failed to purchase and just put his hand on my shoulder and told me it was ok i almost didn t take it i was so shocked and asked if he was sure and he said it s just a bathbomb i got into my car and started to sob not knowing how i am going to eat and pay the rest of my bills this month and i had moments where i wanted to drive somewhere and not return but my mind kept coming back to this person who showed me such kindness and generosity a stranger and they in no way were required to help me i m still emotional over it and i plan on thanking him when i get the bandwidth to do so let this be a message to show people small kindnesses when you can because you may well be saving a life and giving hope,307,14,243.8426988
If everyone on Reddit is American then that means our experiences from a developing country don't matter?,i recently asked on the teaching subreddit to share some teaching advice for a kid of our family friend who is acting uncontrollably cranky a responder started berating me for not taking the kid to therapy i explained to them that i live in a south asian country so accessing and affording therapy for us is extremely difficult i m struggling a lot with mental health they started blaming me for not adding a disclaimer that i m south asian in the main post it s not their fault for being mean to me the majority of the users are americans if i need advice then i better add this in the disclaimer i understand that most reddit users are american but i thought teacher student connection is universal irrespective of nationality i don t understand why can t people put aside their nationality i have had great insightful conversations with lots of people on reddit but i occasionally receive judgemental opinions like this why can t people open up to others experiences if not then at least try to be compassionate it sometimes does make me feel that no matter what we do people from developing countries will always be considered stupid and unwanted edit thank you so much for such heartwarming and encouraging responses i wish to clarify that i still have equal respect for americans as i do for every other being regardless of their background i always try to be level headed but sometimes intrusive thoughts get the better of me as they did in this post every single person who responded to this post you guys are awesome have a great life i ll always be grateful for your help again thank you,314,94,1338.394736
"You are more than the things that are ""wrong"" with you",for whoever needs to hear this today you are valid and you are valuable do not let yourself be defined by your diagnosis you are more than just a collection of the things that are wrong with you you are a person and you are who you are in spite of these things not because of them never let anyone belittle you because of your struggles you are stronger than the people who grit their teeth and bear it because they have not had to jump the same hurdles as you to get where you are it is never shameful or weak to ask for help anyone who tells you otherwise has forgotten that they once had to be spoon fed as a child or has forgotten how many times they ve had to ask their grandchildren to fix their computer stay the path it may be long it may come with unexpected turns but eventually there is light at the end you are valid you are valuable,308,28,1971.357861
"To anyone who was hurt, abused, manipulated or ridiculed by parents/caregivers: it's not your fault and it's not your job to fix them and their shitty problems.",i have come to fully understand something at 25 years of age it s not your fault how adults treated you when you were a kid you literally had not a single ounce of control over their stupidity selfishness and incapability if you were abused hurt ripped apart by their words or even physically injured by those so called grown ups in your childhood it is absolutely and categorically not your fault and it is not your job to fix it it s not your job now and it wasn t your job then you had no control over their actions and no responsibility for them they had the responsibility to care for you and they messed it up big time you did not ask to be born into the situation you were born into you were a vulnerable child whose needs for some reason or another were not fully met and that rests entirely with the adults not with you a child can never be blamed for that and the child who turns into the adult should not blame themselves for their parents shortcomings either also you owe them nothing they may have fed you and put a roof over your head but if they otherwise treated you like shit or still do treat you like shit walk away and don t look back now you re an adult and you have choices and autonomy over your own life you don t need to be around them if you don t want to or if it doesn t feel safe and secure i am so sorry that this happened to you and believe me i understand parents are not all as brilliant and kind as they re supposed to be some of them are assholes just want you to know you re not alone and you can live a happy life as an adult without them,307,29,2129.387745

Found out my daughter is cutting herself,i 32f just found out my 13f daughter is cutting herself she said it s been going on for a little more than a week her brother was the one who told me she showed me them and they are superficial and don t need immediate medical attention i tried to remain calm and just not overreact or panic i let her know that i m sorry she was feeling so strongly that she resorted to hurting herself and i let her know that i don t think badly of her and i want to help her she agreed that she would like to get help so we are going to get a referral from her doctor for a therapist on wednesday she said she does it to relieve stress and when she s feeling upset but that it isn t a suicide attempt i let her know that we need to find another way for her to release stress since this is dangerous i took her with me to work and school today so we could spend some extra time together i m not sure what else i can do i m trying to keep it together but i do feel terrible that she is feeling so low i wish i could take all her pain away edit update thanks for all the support even though i tried my hardest to do what was best it still felt like i wasn t doing enough so it was very reassuring reading through everyone s comments and experiences we got a referral from her pediatrician so now we are waiting for therapy in the mean time we have been doing more activities together and she has been a lot more open to trying stuff yesterday was rough because i spent some one on one time with my son 9 and she felt a little betrayed after we were spending so much time together at first she didn t want to talk to me but eventually she came around and i told her it s normal to feel that way and she s still important even if i spend time with her brother my son has adhd and possibly autism we are in the process of getting an evaluation so he has been getting a lot of attention and she explained how she felt like she was set aside it was a great conversation because i had no idea she had felt that way because it always seemed like she wasn t interested in spending time with me and she would decline most of the time we are planning on doing some fitness activity together but we are still figuring out what she wanted to weight lift but our local gyms don t allow children under 15 she even stopped wearing her jacket which i felt like was huge so i think we are making good progress just hoping we can stick with it through hard times as well,306,87,680.828729
